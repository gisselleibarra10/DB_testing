This summary is a snapshot of the data that was collected on the lastUpdated date. It’s important to understand that the totals in InsightsByAssessment are daily counts based on this date — they aren’t a total sum to date. The InsightsByAssessment data is eventually consistent. This means that when you read data from InsightsByAssessment, the response might not instantly reflect the results of a recently completed write or update operation. If you repeat your read request after a few hours, the response returns the latest data. If you delete an assessment or change its status to inactive, InsightsByAssessment includes data for that assessment as follows."}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/AWSAuditManager\/documentation\/AWSAuditManager\/AuditManagerClientTypes\/InsightsByAssessment","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","navigatorTitle":[{"kind":"identifier","text":"InsightsByAssessment"}],"url":"\/documentation\/awsauditmanager\/auditmanagerclienttypes\/insightsbyassessment"},"doc://AWSAuditManager/documentation/AWSAuditManager/AuditManagerClientTypes/InsightsByAssessment/assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence":{"role":"symbol","title":"assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence","fragments":[{"kind":"keyword","text":"var"},{"kind":"text","text":" "},{"kind":"identifier","text":"assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence"},{"kind":"text","text":": "},{"kind":"typeIdentifier","text":"Int","preciseIdentifier":"s:Si"},{"kind":"text","text":"?"}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"The number of assessment controls that collected non-compliant evidence on the lastUpdated date."}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/AWSAuditManager\/documentation\/AWSAuditManager\/AuditManagerClientTypes\/InsightsByAssessment\/assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/awsauditmanager\/auditmanagerclienttypes\/insightsbyassessment\/assessmentcontrolscountbynoncompliantevidence"}}}
