This summary is a snapshot of the data that your active assessments collected on the lastUpdated date. It’s important to understand that the following totals are daily counts based on this date — they aren’t a total sum to date. The Insights data is eventually consistent. This means that, when you read data from Insights, the response might not instantly reflect the results of a recently completed write or update operation. If you repeat your read request after a few hours, the response should return the latest data. If you delete an assessment or change its status to inactive, InsightsByAssessment includes data for that assessment as follows."}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/AWSAuditManager\/documentation\/AWSAuditManager\/AuditManagerClientTypes\/Insights","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","navigatorTitle":[{"kind":"identifier","text":"Insights"}],"url":"\/documentation\/awsauditmanager\/auditmanagerclienttypes\/insights"},"doc://AWSAuditManager/documentation/AWSAuditManager":{"role":"collection","title":"AWSAuditManager","abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/AWSAuditManager\/documentation\/AWSAuditManager","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/awsauditmanager"},"doc://AWSAuditManager/documentation/AWSAuditManager/AuditManagerClientTypes":{"role":"symbol","title":"AuditManagerClientTypes","fragments":[{"kind":"keyword","text":"enum"},{"kind":"text","text":" "},{"kind":"identifier","text":"AuditManagerClientTypes"}],"abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/AWSAuditManager\/documentation\/AWSAuditManager\/AuditManagerClientTypes","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","navigatorTitle":[{"kind":"identifier","text":"AuditManagerClientTypes"}],"url":"\/documentation\/awsauditmanager\/auditmanagerclienttypes"},"doc://AWSAuditManager/documentation/AWSAuditManager/AuditManagerClientTypes/Insights/init(from:)":{"role":"symbol","title":"init(from:)","fragments":[{"kind":"identifier","text":"init"},{"kind":"text","text":"("},{"kind":"externalParam","text":"from"},{"kind":"text","text":": "},{"kind":"typeIdentifier","text":"Decoder","preciseIdentifier":"s:s7DecoderP"},{"kind":"text","text":") "},{"kind":"keyword","text":"throws"}],"abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/AWSAuditManager\/documentation\/AWSAuditManager\/AuditManagerClientTypes\/Insights\/init(from:)","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/awsauditmanager\/auditmanagerclienttypes\/insights\/init(from:)"}}}
