    /// An optional parameter that indicates a preference for places that are closer to a specified position. If provided, this parameter must contain a pair of numbers. The first number represents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number represents the Y coordinate, or latitude. For example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the position with longitude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847. BiasPosition and FilterBBox are mutually exclusive. Specifying both options results in an error.
    public var biasPosition: [Swift.Double]?
    /// An optional parameter that limits the search results by returning only places that are within the provided bounding box. If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the southwest corner of the bounding box; the second pair of numbers represents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the northeast corner of the bounding box. For example, [-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542] represents a bounding box where the southwest corner has longitude -12.7935 and latitude -37.4835, and the northeast corner has longitude -12.0684 and latitude -36.9542. FilterBBox and BiasPosition are mutually exclusive. Specifying both options results in an error.

    /// The preferred language used to return results. The value must be a valid [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/search/bcp47) language tag, for example, en for English. This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not the results themselves. If no language is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically chooses a language for the result. For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for Athens, Greece, with the language parameter set to en. The result found will most likely be returned as Athens. If you set the language parameter to el, for Greek, then the result found will more likely be returned as Αθήνα. If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be in a language that the provider does support.
