If you change a cluster's StepConcurrencyLevel to be greater than 1 while a step is running, the ActionOnFailure parameter may not behave as you expect. In this case, for a step that fails with this parameter set to CANCEL_AND_WAIT, pending steps and the running step are not canceled; for a step that fails with this parameter set to TERMINATE_CLUSTER, the cluster does not terminate.
