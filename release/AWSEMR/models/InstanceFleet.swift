When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision On-Demand Instances as specified by [InstanceTypeConfig]. Each instance configuration has a specified WeightedCapacity. When an On-Demand Instance is provisioned, the WeightedCapacity units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a WeightedCapacity of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units. You can use [InstanceFleet$ProvisionedOnDemandCapacity] to determine the Spot capacity units that have been provisioned for the instance fleet. If not specified or set to 0, only Spot Instances are provisioned for the instance fleet using TargetSpotCapacity. At least one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity can be specified, and its value must be 1.
