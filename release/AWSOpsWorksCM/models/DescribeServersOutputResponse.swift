For Chef Automate servers: If DescribeServersResponse$Servers$EngineAttributes includes CHEF_MAJOR_UPGRADE_AVAILABLE, you can upgrade the Chef Automate server to Chef Automate 2. To be eligible for upgrade, a server running Chef Automate 1 must have had at least one successful maintenance run after November 1, 2019. For Puppet servers: DescribeServersResponse$Servers$EngineAttributes contains the following two responses:
    ///
    /// * PUPPET_API_CA_CERT, the PEM-encoded CA certificate that is used by the Puppet API over TCP port number 8140. The CA certificate is also used to sign node certificates.
    ///
    /// * PUPPET_API_CRL, a certificate revocation list. The certificate revocation list is for internal maintenance purposes only. For more information about the Puppet certificate revocation list, see [Man Page: puppet certificate_revocation_list](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/man/certificate_revocation_list.html) in the Puppet documentation.
