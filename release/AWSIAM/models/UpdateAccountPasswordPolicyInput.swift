    /// Allows all IAM users in your account to use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to change their own passwords. For more information, see [Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.html) in the IAM User Guide. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that IAM users in the account do not automatically have permissions to change their own password.
    public var allowUsersToChangePassword: Swift.Bool
    /// Prevents IAM users who are accessing the account via the Amazon Web Services Management Console from setting a new console password after their password has expired. The IAM user cannot access the console until an administrator resets the password. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that IAM users can change their passwords after they expire and continue to sign in as the user. In the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the custom password policy option Allow users to change their own password gives IAM users permissions to iam:ChangePassword for only their user and to the iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy action. This option does not attach a permissions policy to each user, rather the permissions are applied at the account-level for all users by IAM. IAM users with iam:ChangePassword permission and active access keys can reset their own expired console password using the CLI or API.

    /// The number of days that an IAM user password is valid. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM user passwords never expire.

    /// The minimum number of characters allowed in an IAM user password. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 6.
    public var minimumPasswordLength: Swift.Int?
    /// Specifies the number of previous passwords that IAM users are prevented from reusing. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM users are not prevented from reusing previous passwords.
    public var passwordReusePrevention: Swift.Int?
    /// Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one lowercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a to z). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one lowercase character.
    public var requireLowercaseCharacters: Swift.Bool
    /// Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one numeric character (0 to 9). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one numeric character.
    public var requireNumbers: Swift.Bool
    /// Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one of the following non-alphanumeric characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | ' If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one symbol character.
    public var requireSymbols: Swift.Bool
    /// Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one uppercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (A to Z). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one uppercase character.
