If the simulation evaluates policies within the same account and specifies all resources (*), then the parameter is not returned. When you make a cross-account request, Amazon Web Services evaluates the request in the trusting account and the trusted account. The request is allowed only if both evaluations return true. For more information about how policies are evaluated, see [Evaluating policies within a single account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics). If an Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies access, the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation does not proceed any further and this parameter is not returned.
