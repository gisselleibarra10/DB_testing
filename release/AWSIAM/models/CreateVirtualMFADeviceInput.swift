This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes.

For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the IAM User Guide. If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
