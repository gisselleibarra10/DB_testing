public struct CreatePolicyInput: Swift.Equatable {
    /// A friendly description of the policy. Typically used to store information about the permissions defined in the policy. For example, "Grants access to production DynamoDB tables." The policy description is immutable. After a value is assigned, it cannot be changed.
    public var description: Swift.String?
    /// The path for the policy. For more information about paths, see [IAM identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html) in the IAM User Guide. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters. You cannot use an asterisk (*) in the path name.
    public var path: Swift.String?
    /// The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for the new policy. You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length). To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see [Grammar of the IAM JSON policy language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html) in the IAM User Guide. The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:
    ///
    /// * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range
    ///
    /// * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \u00FF)
    ///
    /// * The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D)
    /// This member is required.
    public var policyDocument: Swift.String?
    /// The friendly name of the policy. IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".
    /// This member is required.
    public var policyName: Swift.String?
    /// A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM customer managed policy. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the IAM User Guide. If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
