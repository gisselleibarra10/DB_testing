    /// The path for the server certificate. For more information about paths, see [IAM identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html) in the IAM User Guide. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters. If you are uploading a server certificate specifically for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions, you must specify a path using the path parameter. The path must begin with /cloudfront and must include a trailing slash (for example, /cloudfront/test/).

    public var privateKey: Swift.String?
    /// The name for the server certificate. Do not include the path in this value. The name of the certificate cannot contain any spaces. This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-
