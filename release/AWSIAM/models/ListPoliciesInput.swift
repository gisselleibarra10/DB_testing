    /// The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies. This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, set the value to PermissionsBoundary. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned.

To list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account, set Scope to Local. This parameter is optional.
