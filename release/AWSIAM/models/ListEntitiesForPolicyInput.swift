If it is not included, all attached entities (users, groups, and roles) are returned. The argument for this parameter must be one of the valid values listed below.

If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true, and Marker contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
