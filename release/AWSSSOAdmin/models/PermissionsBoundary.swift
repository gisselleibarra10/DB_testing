Specify either CustomerManagedPolicyReference to use the name and path of a customer managed policy, or ManagedPolicyArn to use the ARN of an AWS managed policy. A permissions boundary represents the maximum permissions that any policy can grant your role. For more information, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) in the IAM User Guide. Policies used as permissions boundaries don't provide permissions. You must also attach an IAM policy to the role. To learn how the effective permissions for a role are evaluated, see [IAM JSON policy evaluation logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html) in the IAM User Guide.
