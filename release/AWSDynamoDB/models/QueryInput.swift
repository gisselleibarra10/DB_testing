    /// The condition that specifies the key values for items to be retrieved by the Query action. The condition must perform an equality test on a single partition key value. The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests on a single sort key value. This allows Query to retrieve one item with a given partition key value and sort key value, or several items that have the same partition key value but different sort key values. The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified in the following format: partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be combined using AND with the condition for the sort key. Following is an example, using the = comparison operator for the sort key: partitionKeyName

    /// * sortKeyName=:sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal to :sortkeyval.
    ///
    /// * sortKeyName<:sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than :sortkeyval.

    /// * sortKeyName<=:sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to :sortkeyval.
    ///
    /// * sortKeyName>:sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than :sortkeyval.
    ///
    /// * sortKeyName>= :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval.
    ///
    /// * sortKeyNameBETWEEN:sortkeyval1AND:sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1, and less than or equal to :sortkeyval2.
    ///
    /// * begins_with (sortKeyName, :sortkeyval) - true if the sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the function name begins_with is case-sensitive.
    ///
    ///
    /// Use the ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such as :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at runtime. You can optionally use the ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following KeyConditionExpression parameter causes an error because Size is a reserved word:
    ///

Also, if the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this limit, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to continue the operation.

For type String, the results are stored in order of UTF-8 bytes. For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned. If ScanIndexForward is true, DynamoDB returns the results in the order in which they are stored (by sort key value). This is the default behavior.

    ///
    /// * SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in ProjectionExpression. This return value is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.
