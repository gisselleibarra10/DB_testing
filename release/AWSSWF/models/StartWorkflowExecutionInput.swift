This policy overrides the default child policy specified when registering the workflow type using [RegisterWorkflowType]. The supported child policies are:
    ///
    /// * TERMINATE – The child executions are terminated.
    ///
    /// * REQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.

    /// * ABANDON – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.

Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of "NONE" for this timeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run. An execution start-to-close timeout must be specified either through this parameter or as a default when the workflow type is registered. If neither this parameter nor a default execution start-to-close timeout is specified, a fault is returned.
