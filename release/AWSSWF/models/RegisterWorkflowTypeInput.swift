    /// * REQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.

You can override this default when starting an execution through the [StartWorkflowExecution] Action or StartChildWorkflowExecution[Decision]. The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0. Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of "NONE" for defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run. Exceeding this limit always causes the workflow execution to time out.
