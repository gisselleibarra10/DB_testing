The formality setting controls the level of formal language usage (also known as [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics))) in the translation output. You can set the value to informal or formal. If you don't specify a value for formality, or if the target language doesn't support formality, the translation will ignore the formality setting. Note that asynchronous translation jobs don't support formality. If you provide a value for formality, the StartTextTranslationJob API throws an exception (InvalidRequestException).

To mask profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate replaces them with the grawlix string “?$#@$“. This 5-character sequence is used for each profane word or phrase, regardless of the length or number of words. Amazon Translate doesn't detect profanity in all of its supported languages. For languages that support profanity detection, see [Supported Languages and Language Codes in the Amazon Translate Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html).
