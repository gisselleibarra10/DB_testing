    /// ListExecutions returns the NextToken parameter in the output. You can then pass the NextToken parameter in a subsequent command to continue listing additional executions. This is useful for pagination, for instance. If you have 100 executions for a workflow, you might only want to list first 10. If so, call the API by specifying the max-results: aws transfer list-executions --max-results 10 This returns details for the first 10 executions, as well as the pointer (NextToken) to the eleventh execution. You can now call the API again, supplying the NextToken value you received: aws transfer list-executions --max-results 10 --next-token $somePointerReturnedFromPreviousListResult This call returns the next 10 executions, the 11th through the 20th. You can then repeat the call until the details for all 100 executions have been returned.
