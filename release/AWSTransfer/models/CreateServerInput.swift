    /// The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS. To request a new public certificate, see [Request a public certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) in the Certificate Manager User Guide. To import an existing certificate into ACM, see [Importing certificates into ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html) in the Certificate Manager User Guide. To request a private certificate to use FTPS through private IP addresses, see [Request a private certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-private.html) in the Certificate Manager User Guide. Certificates with the following cryptographic algorithms and key sizes are supported:
    ///
    /// * 2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)
    ///
    /// * 4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)

    /// The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make your endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make your endpoint accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.
    public var endpointDetails: TransferClientTypes.EndpointDetails?
    /// The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it. After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType=VPC. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint. It is recommended that you use VPC as the EndpointType. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT.
    public var endpointType: TransferClientTypes.EndpointType?
    /// The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your server. Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Use a minimum value of 2048 for the -b option. You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or 4096. Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521. Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key. For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string of your choice. If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive. For more information, see [Change the host key for your SFTP-enabled server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key) in the Transfer Family User Guide.

    public var identityProviderDetails: TransferClientTypes.IdentityProviderDetails?
    /// The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is SERVICE_MANAGED, which allows you to store and access user credentials within the Transfer Family service. Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Directory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the Function parameter or the IdentityProviderDetails data type.
    public var identityProviderType: TransferClientTypes.IdentityProviderType?

To have the Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP. If you set the SetStatOption parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a SETSTAT call.
