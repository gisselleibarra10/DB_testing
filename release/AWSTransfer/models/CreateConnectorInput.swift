We use the fileâ€™s parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt, parent directory is /bucket/dir/) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the StartFileTransfer request.
