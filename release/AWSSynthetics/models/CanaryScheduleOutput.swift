For example, rate(1 minute) runs the canary once a minute, rate(10 minutes) runs it once every 10 minutes, and rate(1 hour) runs it once every hour. You can specify a frequency between rate(1 minute) and rate(1 hour). Specifying rate(0 minute) or rate(0 hour) is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started. Use cron(expression) to specify a cron expression.
