You could use this value, for example, to provide an ID that you can use to track a request or to provide other metadata that a service endpoint was programmed to process. The value must consist of no more than 1024 visible US-ASCII characters as specified in [Section 3.3.6. Field Value Components](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6) of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1). The code in your model is responsible for setting or updating any custom attributes in the response. If your code does not set this value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the custom attribute with Trace ID: in your post-processing function. This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services SDKs but not in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.
