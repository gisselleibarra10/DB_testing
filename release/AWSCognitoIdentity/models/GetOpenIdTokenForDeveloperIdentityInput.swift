If the user is from a developer provider, the name-value pair will follow the syntax "developer_provider_name": "developer_user_identifier". The developer provider is the "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users; you provided this domain while creating/updating the identity pool. The developer user identifier is an identifier from your backend that uniquely identifies a user. When you create an identity pool, you can specify the supported logins.

If you don't provide an expiration time, the token is valid for 15 minutes. You can exchange the token with Amazon STS for temporary AWS credentials, which are valid for a maximum of one hour. The maximum token duration you can set is 24 hours. You should take care in setting the expiration time for a token, as there are significant security implications: an attacker could use a leaked token to access your AWS resources for the token's duration. Please provide for a small grace period, usually no more than 5 minutes, to account for clock skew.
