For more information, see [ Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Once the resource is created, you can use [TagResource], [UntagResource], and [ListTagsForResource] to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon Web Services General Reference for actual tagging limits.
