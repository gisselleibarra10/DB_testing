If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.

You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1".
