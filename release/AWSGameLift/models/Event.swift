If any listed launch path exists, GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl.

        ///
        /// * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED -- The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process.

A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your Amazon Web Services account.
