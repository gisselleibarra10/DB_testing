ARN The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example). Supported operators: EQUALS, IN, NOT_IN PLATFORM The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS. Supported operators: EQUALS OS_VERSION The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2). Supported operators: EQUALS, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS, IN, LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, NOT_IN MODEL The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen). Supported operators: CONTAINS, EQUALS, IN, NOT_IN AVAILABILITY The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. Supported operators: EQUALS FORM_FACTOR The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET. Supported operators: EQUALS MANUFACTURER The device manufacturer (for example, Apple).

Supported operators: EQUALS REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Supported operators: EQUALS Because remote debugging is [no longer supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html), this filter is ignored.
