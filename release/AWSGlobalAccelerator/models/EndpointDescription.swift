Client IP address preservation is supported, in specific Amazon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that are Application Load Balancers and Amazon EC2 instances.

The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint.
