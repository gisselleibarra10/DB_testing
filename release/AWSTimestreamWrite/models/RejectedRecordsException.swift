/// WriteRecords would throw this exception in the following cases:
///
/// * Records with duplicate data where there are multiple records with the same dimensions, timestamps, and measure names but:
///
/// * Measure values are different
///
/// * Version is not present in the request or the value of version in the new record is equal to or lower than the existing value
///
///
/// In this case, if Timestream rejects data, the ExistingVersion field in the RejectedRecords response will indicate the current recordâ€™s version. To force an update, you can resend the request with a version for the record set to a value greater than the ExistingVersion.
///
/// * Records with timestamps that lie outside the retention duration of the memory store
///
/// * Records with dimensions or measures that exceed the Timestream defined limits.
