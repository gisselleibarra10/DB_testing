Specifically, ResourceID is created from the strings that come after the word opsmetadata in the ARN. For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager has a ResourceID of either aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager or /aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager.
