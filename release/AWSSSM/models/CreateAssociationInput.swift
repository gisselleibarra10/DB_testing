    /// The document version you want to associate with the target(s). Can be a specific version or the default version. State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new version of a document if that document is shared from another account. State Manager always runs the default version of a document if shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the document version to default.
    public var documentVersion: Swift.String?
    /// The managed node ID. InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include the parameter InstanceID with Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use the parameter InstanceId, you can't use the parameters AssociationName, DocumentVersion, MaxErrors, MaxConcurrency, OutputLocation, or ScheduleExpression. To use these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.
    public var instanceId: Swift.String?
    /// The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
    public var maxConcurrency: Swift.String?
    /// The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
    public var maxErrors: Swift.String?
    /// The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node. You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account. For Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format: arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name  For example: arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.

    public var scheduleExpression: Swift.String?
    /// Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *), you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see [Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. To use offsets, you must specify the ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association immediately after you create it.
    public var scheduleOffset: Swift.Int?
    /// The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter for the [PutComplianceItems] API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the [PutComplianceItems] API operation. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
    public var syncCompliance: SsmClientTypes.AssociationSyncCompliance?
    /// Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an association to identify the type of resource to which it applies, the environment, or the purpose of the association.
