Specifically, ResourceID is created from the strings that come after the word opsmetadata in the ARN. For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager has a ResourceID of either aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager or /aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager. For the Document and Parameter values, use the name of the resource. The ManagedInstance type for this API operation is only for on-premises managed nodes. Specify the name of the managed node in the following format: mi-ID_number. For example, mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f.
