        /// * Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the managed node, but the execution wasn't complete before the execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed node. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed node. The managed node might not exist or might not be responding.
