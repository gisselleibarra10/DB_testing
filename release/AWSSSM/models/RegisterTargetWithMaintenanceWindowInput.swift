    /// The targets to register with the maintenance window. In other words, the managed nodes to run commands on when the maintenance window runs. If a single maintenance window task is registered with multiple targets, its task invocations occur sequentially and not in parallel. If your task must run on multiple targets at the same time, register a task for each target individually and assign each task the same priority level. You can specify targets using managed node IDs, resource group names, or tags that have been applied to managed nodes. Example 1: Specify managed node IDs Key=InstanceIds,Values=,, Example 2: Use tag key-pairs applied to managed nodes Key=tag:,Values=, Example 3: Use tag-keys applied to managed nodes Key=tag-key,Values=, Example 4: Use resource group names Key=resource-groups:Name,Values= Example 5: Use filters for resource group types Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=, For Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters, specify resource types in the following format Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC For more information about these examples formats, including the best use case for each one, see [Examples: Register targets with a maintenance window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-cli-tutorial-targets-examples.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.
