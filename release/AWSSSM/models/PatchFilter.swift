extension SsmClientTypes {
    /// Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline. A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The filter key is a patch property. For example, the available filter keys for WINDOWS are PATCH_SET, PRODUCT, PRODUCT_FAMILY, CLASSIFICATION, and MSRC_SEVERITY. The filter values define a matching criterion for the patch property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key is PRODUCT and the filter values are ["Office 2013", "Office 2016"], then the filter accepts all patches where product name is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The filter values can be exact values for the patch property given as a key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values. You can view lists of valid values for the patch properties by running the DescribePatchProperties command. For information about which patch properties can be used with each major operating system, see [DescribePatchProperties].
