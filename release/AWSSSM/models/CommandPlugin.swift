        /// * In Progress: The command has been sent to the managed node but hasn't reached a terminal state.

        /// * Success: The execution of the command or plugin was successfully completed. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to the managed node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the managed node, but the execution wasn't complete before the execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed node. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.
        ///
        /// * Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed node. The managed node might not exist, or it might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, and they don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
