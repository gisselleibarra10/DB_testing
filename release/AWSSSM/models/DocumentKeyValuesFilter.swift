    /// Name is another Amazon Web Services-provided key. If you use Name as a key, you can use a name prefix to return a list of documents. For example, in the Amazon Web Services CLI, to return a list of all documents that begin with Te, run the following command: aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Name,Values=Te You can also use the TargetType Amazon Web Services-provided key. For a list of valid resource type values that can be used with this key, see [Amazon Web Services resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) in the CloudFormation User Guide. If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are identified by all the tags are returned in the results. If you specify more than two values for a key, documents that are identified by any of the values are returned in the results. To specify a custom key-value pair, use the format Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName. For example, if you created a key called region and are using the Amazon Web Services CLI to call the list-documents command: aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=tag:region,Values=east,west Key=Owner,Values=Self
    public struct DocumentKeyValuesFilter: Swift.Equatable {
        /// The name of the filter key.
        public var key: Swift.String?
        /// The value for the filter key.
        public var values: [Swift.String]?

        public init (
            key: Swift.String? = nil,
            values: [Swift.String]? = nil
        )
        {
            self.key = key
            self.values = values
        }
