    /// Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB. Operational data keys can't begin with the following: amazon, aws, amzn, ssm, /amazon, /aws, /amzn, /ssm. You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the [DescribeOpsItems] API operation) can view and search on the specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the [GetOpsItem] API operation). Use the /aws/resources key in OperationalData to specify a related resource in the request. Use the /aws/automations key in OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use these keys, see [Creating OpsItems manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-creating-OpsItems.html#OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.

For more information, see [Getting started with OpsCenter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-getting-started.html#OpsCenter-getting-started-user-permissions) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. Tags use a key-value pair. For example: Key=Department,Value=Finance To add tags to a new OpsItem, a user must have IAM permissions for both the ssm:CreateOpsItems operation and the ssm:AddTagsToResource operation. To add tags to an existing OpsItem, use the [AddTagsToResource] operation.
