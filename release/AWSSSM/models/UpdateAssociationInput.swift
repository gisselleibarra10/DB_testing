    /// By default, when you update an association, the system runs it immediately after it is updated and then according to the schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an association to run immediately after you update it. This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions. If you chose this option when you created an association and later you edit that association or you make changes to the SSM document on which that association is based (by using the Documents page in the console), State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval. For example, if you chose the Latest version of an SSM document when you created an association and you edit the association by choosing a different document version on the Documents page, State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval if you previously selected this option. If this option wasn't selected, State Manager immediately runs the association. You can reset this option. To do so, specify the no-apply-only-at-cron-interval parameter when you update the association from the command line. This parameter forces the association to run immediately after updating it and according to the interval specified.

    /// The document version you want update for the association. State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new version of a document if that document is shared from another account. State Manager always runs the default version of a document if shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the document version to default.
    public var documentVersion: Swift.String?
    /// The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
    public var maxConcurrency: Swift.String?
    /// The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
    public var maxErrors: Swift.String?
    /// The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node. You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account. For Systems Manager document (SSM document) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format: arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name  For example: arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.

    public var scheduleExpression: Swift.String?
    /// Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *), you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see [Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. To use offsets, you must specify the ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association immediately after you create it.
    public var scheduleOffset: Swift.Int?
    /// The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter for the [PutComplianceItems] API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the [PutComplianceItems] API operation. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
