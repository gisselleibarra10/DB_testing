/// Parameter Store retains the 100 most recently created versions of a parameter. After this number of versions has been created, Parameter Store deletes the oldest version when a new one is created. However, if the oldest version has a label attached to it, Parameter Store won't delete the version and instead presents this error message: An error occurred (ParameterMaxVersionLimitExceeded) when calling the PutParameter operation: You attempted to create a new version of parameter-name by calling the PutParameter API with the overwrite flag. Version version-number, the oldest version, can't be deleted because it has a label associated with it. Move the label to another version of the parameter, and try again. This safeguard is to prevent parameter versions with mission critical labels assigned to them from being deleted. To continue creating new parameters, first move the label from the oldest version of the parameter to a newer one for use in your operations. For information about moving parameter labels, see [Move a parameter label (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-labels.html#sysman-paramstore-labels-console-move) or [Move a parameter label (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-labels.html#sysman-paramstore-labels-cli-move) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.
