The mean forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribution is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial).

    ///
    /// * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
    ///
    /// * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
    ///
    /// * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
    ///
    /// * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
    ///
    /// * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
    ///
    /// * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
    ///
    /// * Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
