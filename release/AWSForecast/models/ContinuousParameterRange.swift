        /// The scale that hyperparameter tuning uses to search the hyperparameter range. Valid values: Auto Amazon Forecast hyperparameter tuning chooses the best scale for the hyperparameter. Linear Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range by using a linear scale. Logarithmic Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range by using a logarithmic scale. Logarithmic scaling works only for ranges that have values greater than 0. ReverseLogarithmic hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range by using a reverse logarithmic scale. Reverse logarithmic scaling works only for ranges that are entirely within the range 0 <= x < 1.0. For information about choosing a hyperparameter scale, see [Hyperparameter Scaling](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning-define-ranges.html#scaling-type).
