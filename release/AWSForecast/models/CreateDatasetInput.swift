When you add a dataset to a dataset group, this value and the value specified for the Domain parameter of the [CreateDatasetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateDatasetGroup.html) operation must match. The Domain and DatasetType that you choose determine the fields that must be present in the training data that you import to the dataset. For example, if you choose the RETAIL domain and TARGET_TIME_SERIES as the DatasetType, Amazon Forecast requires item_id, timestamp, and demand fields to be present in your data. For more information, see [Importing datasets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html).

    ///
    /// * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
    ///
    /// * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
    ///
    /// * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
    ///
    /// * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
    ///
    /// * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
    ///
    /// * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
    ///
    /// * Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
