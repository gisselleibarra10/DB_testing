public struct RotateSecretInput: Swift.Equatable {
    /// A unique identifier for the new version of the secret that helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during rotation. This value becomes the VersionId of the new version. If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request for this parameter. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new versions and include that value in the request. You only need to specify this value if you implement your own retry logic and you want to ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt to create a secret version twice. We recommend that you generate a [UUID-type](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.
    public var clientRequestToken: Swift.String?
    /// Specifies whether to rotate the secret immediately or wait until the next scheduled rotation window. The rotation schedule is defined in [RotateSecretRequest$RotationRules]. If you don't immediately rotate the secret, Secrets Manager tests the rotation configuration by running the [testSecret] step(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_how.html) of the Lambda rotation function. The test creates an AWSPENDING version of the secret and then removes it. If you don't specify this value, then by default, Secrets Manager rotates the secret immediately.
    public var rotateImmediately: Swift.Bool?
    /// The ARN of the Lambda rotation function that can rotate the secret.
    public var rotationLambdaARN: Swift.String?
    /// A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.
    public var rotationRules: SecretsManagerClientTypes.RotationRulesType?
    /// The ARN or name of the secret to rotate. For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See [Finding a secret from a partial ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen).
