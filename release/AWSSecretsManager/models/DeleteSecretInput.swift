public struct DeleteSecretInput: Swift.Equatable {
    /// Specifies whether to delete the secret without any recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and RecoveryWindowInDays in the same call. If you don't use either, then Secrets Manager defaults to a 30 day recovery window. Secrets Manager performs the actual deletion with an asynchronous background process, so there might be a short delay before the secret is permanently deleted. If you delete a secret and then immediately create a secret with the same name, use appropriate back off and retry logic. Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal recovery window before the permanent deletion that Secrets Manager would normally impose with the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter. If you delete a secret with the ForceDeleteWithouRecovery parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.
