Either the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. The effect of disabling or deleting a key, or revoking a grant is not immediate. The member resource might take some time to find that the key is inaccessible. When a resource is in this state, we recommend deleting and recreating the resource.
