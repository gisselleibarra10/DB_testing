    /// A set of metadata key-value pairs. Contains information, such as a resource name, required to restore a recovery point. You can get configuration metadata about a resource at the time it was backed up by calling GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata. However, values in addition to those provided by GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata might be required to restore a resource. For example, you might need to provide a new resource name if the original already exists. You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) instance:
    ///
    /// * file-system-id: The ID of the Amazon EFS file system that is backed up by Backup. Returned in GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata.
    ///
    /// * Encrypted: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file system is encrypted. If KmsKeyId is specified, Encrypted must be set to true.
    ///
    /// * KmsKeyId: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is used to encrypt the restored file system. You can specify a key from another Amazon Web Services account provided that key it is properly shared with your account via Amazon Web Services KMS.
    ///
    /// * PerformanceMode: Specifies the throughput mode of the file system.
    ///
    /// * CreationToken: A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness (idempotency) of the request.
    ///
    /// * newFileSystem: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.
    ///
    /// * ItemsToRestore: An array of one to five strings where each string is a file path. Use ItemsToRestore to restore specific files or directories rather than the entire file system. This parameter is optional. For example, "itemsToRestore":"[\"/my.test\"]".
    /// This member is required.
    public var metadata: [Swift.String:Swift.String]?
    /// An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example, arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45.
    /// This member is required.
    public var recoveryPointArn: Swift.String?
    /// Starts a job to restore a recovery point for one of the following resources:
    ///
    /// * Aurora for Amazon Aurora
    ///
    /// * DocumentDB for Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)
    ///
    /// * DynamoDB for Amazon DynamoDB
    ///
    /// * EBS for Amazon Elastic Block Store

    /// * EC2 for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
