Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names are separated by slashes. For more information about paths, see [Access Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clouddirectory/latest/developerguide/directory_objects_access_objects.html).

When creating objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of the created object. An objectâ€™s identifier is immutable and no two objects will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an object with ObjectIdentifier, the ObjectIdentifier must be wrapped in double quotes.

        /// * /some/path - Identifies the object based on path
