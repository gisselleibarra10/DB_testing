    /// Validity specifies the period of time during which a certificate is valid. Validity can be expressed as an explicit date and time when the validity of a certificate starts or expires, or as a span of time after issuance, stated in days, months, or years. For more information, see [Validity](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5) in RFC 5280. ACM Private CA API consumes the Validity data type differently in two distinct parameters of the IssueCertificate action. The required parameter IssueCertificate:Validity specifies the end of a certificate's validity period. The optional parameter IssueCertificate:ValidityNotBefore specifies a customized starting time for the validity period.

Type definitions with values include a sample input value and the resulting output. END_DATE: The specific date and time when the certificate will expire, expressed using UTCTime (YYMMDDHHMMSS) or GeneralizedTime (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) format. When UTCTime is used, if the year field (YY) is greater than or equal to 50, the year is interpreted as 19YY. If the year field is less than 50, the year is interpreted as 20YY.
