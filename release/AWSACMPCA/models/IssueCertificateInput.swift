For more information about using these templates, see [Understanding Certificate Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/UsingTemplates.html). If conflicting or duplicate certificate information is supplied during certificate issuance, ACM Private CA applies [order of operation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/UsingTemplates.html#template-order-of-operations) to determine what information is used.

The usr_cert block in the configuration file contains your X509 version 3 extensions. openssl req -new -config openssl_rsa.cnf -extensions usr_cert -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout private/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr Note: A CSR must provide either a subject name or a subject alternative name or the request will be rejected.

Therefore, if you call IssueCertificate multiple times with the same idempotency token within one minute, ACM Private CA recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, PCA recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.
    public var idempotencyToken: Swift.String?
    /// The name of the algorithm that will be used to sign the certificate to be issued. This parameter should not be confused with the SigningAlgorithm parameter used to sign a CSR in the CreateCertificateAuthority action.

    public var signingAlgorithm: AcmPcaClientTypes.SigningAlgorithm?
    /// Specifies a custom configuration template to use when issuing a certificate. If this parameter is not provided, ACM Private CA defaults to the EndEntityCertificate/V1 template. For CA certificates, you should choose the shortest path length that meets your needs. The path length is indicated by the PathLenN portion of the ARN, where N is the [CA depth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaTerms.html#terms-cadepth). Note: The CA depth configured on a subordinate CA certificate must not exceed the limit set by its parents in the CA hierarchy. For a list of TemplateArn values supported by ACM Private CA, see [Understanding Certificate Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/UsingTemplates.html).
    public var templateArn: Swift.String?
    /// Information describing the end of the validity period of the certificate. This parameter sets the “Not After” date for the certificate. Certificate validity is the period of time during which a certificate is valid. Validity can be expressed as an explicit date and time when the certificate expires, or as a span of time after issuance, stated in days, months, or years. For more information, see [Validity](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5) in RFC 5280. This value is unaffected when ValidityNotBefore is also specified. For example, if Validity is set to 20 days in the future, the certificate will expire 20 days from issuance time regardless of the ValidityNotBefore value. The end of the validity period configured on a certificate must not exceed the limit set on its parents in the CA hierarchy.
    /// This member is required.
    public var validity: AcmPcaClientTypes.Validity?
    /// Information describing the start of the validity period of the certificate. This parameter sets the “Not Before" date for the certificate. By default, when issuing a certificate, ACM Private CA sets the "Not Before" date to the issuance time minus 60 minutes. This compensates for clock inconsistencies across computer systems. The ValidityNotBefore parameter can be used to customize the “Not Before” value. Unlike the Validity parameter, the ValidityNotBefore parameter is optional. The ValidityNotBefore value is expressed as an explicit date and time, using the Validity type value ABSOLUTE. For more information, see [Validity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_Validity.html) in this API reference and [Validity](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5) in RFC 5280.
