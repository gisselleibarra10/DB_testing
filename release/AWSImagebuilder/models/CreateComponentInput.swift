    /// The semantic version of the component. This version follows the semantic version syntax. The semantic version has four nodes: ../. You can assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of them. Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node. Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.
