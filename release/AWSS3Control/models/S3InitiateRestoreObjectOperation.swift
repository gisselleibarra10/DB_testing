Conversely, do not set ExpirationInDays when creating S3 Initiate Restore Object jobs that target S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tier objects. Objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering archive access tiers are not subject to restore expiry, so specifying ExpirationInDays results in restore request failure. S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class objects or on S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access storage tier objects, but not both types in the same job. If you need to restore objects of both types you must create separate Batch Operations jobs.
