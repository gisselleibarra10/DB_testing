    /// Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a [StartTaskExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html) operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification, and so on. A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in [StartTaskExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html), the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each task execution by specifying an overriding Options value to [StartTaskExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html).

If you set Atime to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the original Atime attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING phase). However, Atime's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis. Default value: BEST_EFFORTBEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file Atime value (recommended). NONE: Ignore Atime. If Atime is set to BEST_EFFORT, Mtime must be set to PRESERVE. If Atime is set to NONE, Mtime must also be NONE.

This option is required for cases when you need to run the same task more than one time. Default Value: PRESERVEPRESERVE: Preserve original Mtime (recommended) NONE: Ignore Mtime. If Mtime is set to PRESERVE, Atime must be set to BEST_EFFORT. If Mtime is set to NONE, Atime must also be set to NONE.
        public var mtime: DataSyncClientTypes.Mtime?

        /// A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to NEVER a destination file will not be replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those changes. Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost.

DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker. Default value: NONENONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS.
