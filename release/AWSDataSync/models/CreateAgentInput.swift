Alternatively, you can get it from the DataSync console. The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your agent in the query string parameter activationKey. It might also include other activation-related parameters; however, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass to this API call determine the actual configuration of your agent. For more information, see Activating an Agent in the DataSync User Guide.
