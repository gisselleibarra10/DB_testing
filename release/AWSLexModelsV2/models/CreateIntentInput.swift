For example, suppose that your bot determines that the user's name is John. You Lambda function might retrieve John's information from a backend database and prepopulate some of the values. For example, if you find that John is gluten intolerant, you might set the corresponding intent slot, glutenIntolerant to true.

For example, if there are two intents with different input contexts that respond to the same utterances, only the intent with the active context will respond. An intent may have up to 5 input contexts. If an intent has multiple input contexts, all of the contexts must be active to consider the intent.
