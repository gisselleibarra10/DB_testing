TEMPORAL: This filter is useful for both source content that is noisy (when it has excessive digital artifacts) and source content that is clean. When the content is noisy, the filter cleans up the source content before the encoding phase, with these two effects: First, it improves the output video quality because the content has been cleaned up. Secondly, it decreases the bandwidth because MediaLive does not waste bits on encoding noise. When the content is reasonably clean, the filter tends to decrease the bitrate.
