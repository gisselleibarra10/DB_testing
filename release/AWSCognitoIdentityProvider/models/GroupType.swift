Two groups can have the same Precedence value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same Precedence have the same role ARN, that role is used in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the cognito:preferred_role claim isn't set in users' tokens. The default Precedence value is null.
