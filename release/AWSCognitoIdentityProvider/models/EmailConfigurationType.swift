Amazon Cognito can send email messages with Amazon Simple Email Service resources in the Amazon Web Services Region where you created your user pool, and in alternate Regions in some cases. For more information on the supported Regions, see [Email settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-email.html).

A configuration set is applied to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. Once applied, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. Configuration sets can be used to apply the following types of rules to emails: Event publishing Amazon Simple Email Service can track the number of send, delivery, open, click, bounce, and complaint events for each email sent. Use event publishing to send information about these events to other Amazon Web Services services such as and Amazon CloudWatch IP pool management When leasing dedicated IP addresses with Amazon Simple Email Service, you can create groups of IP addresses, called dedicated IP pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools with configuration sets.

        /// Specifies whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in functionality to send your users email messages, or uses your Amazon Simple Email Service email configuration. Specify one of the following values: COGNITO_DEFAULT When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses its built-in email functionality. When you use the default option, Amazon Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your user pool. For typical production environments, the default email limit is less than the required delivery volume. To achieve a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your Amazon SES email configuration. To look up the email delivery limit for the default option, see [Limits in ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the Developer Guide. The default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com. To customize the FROM address, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter. DEVELOPER When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your Amazon SES configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to send email from your verified email address. When you use this option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified email address in your Amazon Web Services account. If you use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter. Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires additional permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a service-linked role, which is a type of role, in your Amazon Web Services account. This role contains the permissions that allow to access Amazon SES and send email messages with your address. For more information about the service-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see [Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.
