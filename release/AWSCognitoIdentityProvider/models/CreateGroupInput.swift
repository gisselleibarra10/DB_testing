Groups with lower Precedence values take precedence over groups with higher or null Precedence values. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value whose role ARN is given in the user's tokens for the cognito:roles and cognito:preferred_role claims. Two groups can have the same Precedence value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same Precedence have the same role ARN, that role is used in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the cognito:preferred_role claim isn't set in users' tokens. The default Precedence value is null. The maximum Precedence value is 2^31-1.
