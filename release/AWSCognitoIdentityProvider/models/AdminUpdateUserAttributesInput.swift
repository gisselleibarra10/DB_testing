/// Represents the request to update the user's attributes as an administrator.
public struct AdminUpdateUserAttributesInput: Swift.Equatable {
    /// A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers. You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminUpdateUserAttributes API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminUpdateUserAttributes request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs. For more information, see [ Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:
    ///
    /// * Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.
    ///
    /// * Validate the ClientMetadata value.
    ///
    /// * Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to provide sensitive information.
    public var clientMetadata: [Swift.String:Swift.String]?
    /// An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes. For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom: prefix to the attribute name. If your user pool requires verification before Amazon Cognito updates an attribute value that you specify in this request, Amazon Cognito doesn’t immediately update the value of that attribute. After your user receives and responds to a verification message to verify the new value, Amazon Cognito updates the attribute value. Your user can sign in and receive messages with the original attribute value until they verify the new value. To update the value of an attribute that requires verification in the same API request, include the email_verified or phone_number_verified attribute, with a value of true. If you set the email_verified or phone_number_verified value for an email or phone_number attribute that requires verification to true, Amazon Cognito doesn’t send a verification message to your user.
