Separate multiple values for one parameter with a comma. For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For filters with expressions that use an EXCLUDE element to exclude items, you can omit the filter-values. In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.
