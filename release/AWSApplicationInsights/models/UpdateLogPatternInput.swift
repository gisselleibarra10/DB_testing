A pattern of rank 1 will be the first to get matched to a log line. A pattern of rank 1,000,000 will be last to get matched. When you configure custom log patterns from the console, a Low severity pattern translates to a 750,000 rank. A Medium severity pattern translates to a 500,000 rank. And a High severity pattern translates to a 250,000 rank. Rank values less than 1 or greater than 1,000,000 are reserved for AWS-provided patterns.
