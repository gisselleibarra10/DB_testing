Tags enable you to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Firewall Manager combines the tags with "AND" so that, if you add more than one tag to a policy scope, a resource must have all the specified tags to be included or excluded. For more information, see [Working with Tag Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html).
