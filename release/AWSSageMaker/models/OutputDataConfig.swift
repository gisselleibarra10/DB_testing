        /// If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS key, the SageMaker execution role must include permissions to call kms:Encrypt. If you don't provide a KMS key ID, SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account. SageMaker uses server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig. If you use a bucket policy with an s3:PutObject permission that only allows objects with server-side encryption, set the condition key of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms". For more information, see [KMS-Managed Encryption Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your CreateTrainingJob, CreateTransformJob, or CreateHyperParameterTuningJob requests. For more information, see [Using Key Policies in Amazon Web Services KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide.
