One of the following values: Auto SageMaker hyperparameter tuning chooses the best scale for the hyperparameter. Linear Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range by using a linear scale. Logarithmic Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range by using a logarithmic scale. Logarithmic scaling works only for ranges that have only values greater than 0. ReverseLogarithmic Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in the hyperparameter range by using a reverse logarithmic scale. Reverse logarithmic scaling works only for ranges that are entirely within the range 0<=x<1.0.
