If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default Amazon Web Services KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account to encrypt your output data. If you use a bucket policy with an s3:PutObject permission that only allows objects with server-side encryption, set the condition key of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms". For more information, see [KMS-Managed Encryption Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
