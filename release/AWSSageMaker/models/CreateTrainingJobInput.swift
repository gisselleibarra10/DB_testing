The complete and intermediate results of jobs are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, and can be used as a starting point to train models incrementally.

You can specify a maximum of 100 hyperparameters. Each hyperparameter is a key-value pair. Each key and value is limited to 256 characters, as specified by the Length Constraint. You must not include any security-sensitive information, such as account access IDs, secrets, and tokens, in the dictionary for configuring hyperparameters. SageMaker rejects the training job request and returns an exception error for detected credentials, if such user input is found.

The configuration for each channel provides the S3, EFS, or FSx location where the input data is stored. It also provides information about the stored data: the MIME type, compression method, and whether the data is wrapped in RecordIO format. Depending on the input mode that the algorithm supports, SageMaker either copies input data files from an S3 bucket to a local directory in the Docker container, or makes it available as input streams. For example, if you specify an EFS location, input data files are available as input streams. They do not need to be downloaded.

You grant permissions for all of these tasks to an IAM role. For more information, see [SageMaker Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html).

To stop a job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost.
