    /// A name for the auto scaling configuration. When you use it for the first time in an Amazon Web Services Region, App Runner creates revision number 1 of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration. The name DefaultConfiguration is reserved (it's the configuration that App Runner uses if you don't provide a custome one). You can't use it to create a new auto scaling configuration, and you can't create a revision of it. When you want to use your own auto scaling configuration for your App Runner service, create a configuration with a different name, and then provide it when you create or update your service.

The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset. App Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.
