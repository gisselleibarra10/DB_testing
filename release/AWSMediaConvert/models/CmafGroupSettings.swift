Choose Thumbnail and full frame (THUMBNAIL_AND_FULLFRAME) to generate tiled thumbnails and full-resolution images of single frames. When you enable Write HLS manifest (WriteHlsManifest), MediaConvert creates a child manifest for each set of images that you generate and adds corresponding entries to the parent manifest. When you enable Write DASH manifest (WriteDashManifest), MediaConvert adds an entry in the .mpd manifest for each set of images that you generate. A common application for these images is Roku trick mode. The thumbnails and full-frame images that MediaConvert creates with this feature are compatible with this Roku specification: https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/media-playback/trick-mode/hls-and-dash.md

Choose a value that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than your segment length. When you specify a value for this setting, the encoder will combine any final segment that is shorter than the length that you specify with the previous segment. For example, your segment length is 3 seconds and your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum final segment length; when you set the minimum final segment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5 seconds.
