When set to SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment target duration is rounded up to the nearest integer value if fraction seconds are greater than or equal to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5 (< 0.5).

Some older players may experience interrupted playback when the actual duration of a track in a segment is longer than the target duration.
