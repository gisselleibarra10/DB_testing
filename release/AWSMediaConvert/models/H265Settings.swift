For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation.

For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type.

To enable this automatic behavior, keep the default value by leaving this setting out of your JSON job specification. In the console, do this by keeping the default empty value. When you explicitly specify a value for this setting, the encoder determines whether to skip a cadence-driven I-frame by the value you set. For example, if you set Min I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a cadence-driven I-frame would fall within 5 frames of a scene-change I-frame, then the encoder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way, one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched slightly. When the cadence-driven I-frames are farther from the scene-change I-frame than the value you set, then the encoder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs surrounding the scene change are smaller than the usual cadence GOPs.

In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs.

Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature.
