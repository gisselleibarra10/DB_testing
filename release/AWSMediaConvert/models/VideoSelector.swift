If your input video is HDR 10 and the SMPTE ST 2086 Mastering Display Color Volume static metadata isn't present in your video stream, or if that metadata is present but not accurate, choose Force HDR 10 (FORCE_HDR10) here and specify correct values in the input HDR 10 metadata (Hdr10Metadata) settings.

The Color space usage setting determines which takes precedence. Choose Force (FORCE) to use color metadata from the input job settings. If you don't specify values for those settings, the service defaults to using metadata from your input. FALLBACK - Choose Fallback (FALLBACK) to use color metadata from the source when it is present. If there's no color metadata in your input file, the service defaults to using values you specify in the input settings.

Appropriate values vary depending on the input video and must be provided by a color grader. The color grader generates these values during the HDR 10 mastering process. The valid range for each of these settings is 0 to 50,000. Each increment represents 0.00002 in CIE1931 color coordinate. Related settings - When you specify these values, you must also set Color space (ColorSpace) to HDR 10 (HDR10). To specify whether the the values you specify here take precedence over the values in the metadata of your input file, set Color space usage (ColorSpaceUsage). To specify whether color metadata is included in an output, set Color metadata (ColorMetadata).

Examples: Input audio track has a delayed start. Input video track ends before audio ends. When you set Pad video (padVideo) to Black (BLACK), MediaConvert generates black video frames so that output video and audio durations match. Black video frames are added at the beginning or end, depending on your input. To keep the default behavior and not generate black video, set Pad video to Disabled (DISABLED) or leave blank.

You can specify a clockwise rotation of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. If your input video container is .mov or .mp4 and your input has rotation metadata, you can choose Automatic to have the service rotate your video according to the rotation specified in the metadata. The rotation must be within one degree of 90, 180, or 270 degrees. If the rotation metadata specifies any other rotation, the service will default to no rotation. By default, the service does no rotation, even if your input video has rotation metadata. The service doesn't pass through rotation metadata.

When you do, MediaConvert ignores any sample range information in the input metadata.
