For example, if resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object, the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it. Replace the text between less than and greater than symbols (<>) with resource-specific information.
