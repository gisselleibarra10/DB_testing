Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution. Specify only the object name, for example, index.html. Don't add a / before the object name. If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty DefaultRootObject element. To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty DefaultRootObject element. To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object. For more information about the default root object, see [Creating a Default Root Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

Viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version. For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLSv1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Indication (SNI). For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/3, viewers must support TLSv1.3 and Server Name Indication (SNI). CloudFront supports HTTP/3 connection migration to allow the viewer to switch networks without losing connection. For more information about connection migration, see [Connection Migration](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-connection-migration) at RFC 9000. For more information about supported TLSv1.3 ciphers, see [Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html).

        /// If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify true. If you specify false, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code NOERROR and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the IpAddress parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see [Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:
        ///
        /// * You enable IPv6 for the distribution
        ///
        /// * You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects

If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance. For more information about price classes, see [Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example 473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a. WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html).
