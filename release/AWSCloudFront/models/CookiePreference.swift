If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use CookiesConfig in a cache policy. See CachePolicy. If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use CookiesConfig in an origin request policy. See OriginRequestPolicy. A complex type that specifies whether you want CloudFront to forward cookies to the origin and, if so, which ones. For more information about forwarding cookies to the origin, see [Caching Content Based on Cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Cookies.html) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

Specifies which cookies to forward to the origin for this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies specified in the WhitelistedNames complex type. Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache behavior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3 origin, specify none for the Forward element.

Required if you specify whitelist for the value of Forward. A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies. If you specify all or none for the value of Forward, omit WhitelistedNames. If you change the value of Forward from whitelist to all or none and you don't delete the WhitelistedNames element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically. For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see [ CloudFront Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
