        /// The condition to apply to the key value when querying for findings with a map filter. To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use EQUALS. For example, for the ResourceTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security matches findings that have the value Security for the tag Department. To search for values other than the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS. For example, for the ResourceTags field, the filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches findings that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department. EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR. A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND. A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. You cannot have both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.
