They also include service-control policies (SCPs) that are attached to an Amazon Web Services organization, organizational unit (OU), or an account. Resource policies grant permissions on Amazon Web Services resources. Resource policies include trust policies for IAM roles and bucket policies for Amazon S3 buckets. You can provide a generic input such as identity policy or resource policy or a specific input such as managed policy or Amazon S3 bucket policy.

For example, to validate a resource policy to attach to an Amazon S3 bucket, you can choose AWS::S3::Bucket for the policy validation resource type. For resource types not supported as valid values, IAM Access Analyzer runs policy checks that apply to all resource policies. For example, to validate a resource policy to attach to a KMS key, do not specify a value for the policy validation resource type and IAM Access Analyzer will run policy checks that apply to all resource policies.
