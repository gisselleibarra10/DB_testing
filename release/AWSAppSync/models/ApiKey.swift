    /// Describes an API key. Customers invoke AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as an identity mechanism. There are two key versions: da1: We introduced this version at launch in November 2017. These keys always expire after 7 days. Amazon DynamoDB TTL manages key expiration. These keys ceased to be valid after February 21, 2018, and they should no longer be used.
    ///
    /// * ListApiKeys returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
    ///
    /// * CreateApiKey returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
    ///
    /// * UpdateApiKey is not available for this key version.
    ///
    /// * DeleteApiKey deletes the item from the table.
    ///
    /// * Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results in a bug where keys are not automatically deleted because DynamoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one-time action, we deleted these keys from the table on February 21, 2018.
