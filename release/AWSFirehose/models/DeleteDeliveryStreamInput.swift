Kinesis Data Firehose might be unable to retire the grant due to a customer error, such as when the CMK or the grant are in an invalid state. If you force deletion, you can then use the [RevokeGrant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeGrant.html) operation to revoke the grant you gave to Kinesis Data Firehose. If a failure to retire the grant happens due to an AWS KMS issue, Kinesis Data Firehose keeps retrying the delete operation. The default value is false.
