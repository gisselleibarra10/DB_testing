For more information, see the "Optional Parameters" section of [Amazon Redshift COPY command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html). Some possible examples that would apply to Kinesis Data Firehose are as follows: delimiter '\t' lzop; - fields are delimited with "\t" (TAB character) and compressed using lzop. delimiter '|' - fields are delimited with "|" (this is the default delimiter). delimiter '|' escape - the delimiter should be escaped. fixedwidth 'venueid:3,venuename:25,venuecity:12,venuestate:2,venueseats:6' - fields are fixed width in the source, with each width specified after every column in the table. JSON 's3://mybucket/jsonpaths.txt' - data is in JSON format, and the path specified is the format of the data. For more examples, see [Amazon Redshift COPY command examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY_command_examples.html).
