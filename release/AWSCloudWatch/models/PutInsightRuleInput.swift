You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag values. To be able to associate tags with a rule, you must have the cloudwatch:TagResource permission in addition to the cloudwatch:PutInsightRule permission.

To change the tags of an existing rule, use [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html).
