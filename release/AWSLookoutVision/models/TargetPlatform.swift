If you specify NVIDIA as an accelerator, you must also specify the gpu-code, trt-ver, and cuda-ver compiler options. If you don't specify an accelerator, Lookout for Vision uses the CPU for compilation and we highly recommend that you use the [GreengrassConfiguration$CompilerOptions] field. For example, you can use the following compiler options for CPU:
        ///
        /// * mcpu: CPU micro-architecture. For example, {'mcpu': 'skylake-avx512'}
        ///
        /// * mattr: CPU flags. For example, {'mattr': ['+neon', '+vfpv4']}

        /// This member is required.
        public var arch: LookoutVisionClientTypes.TargetPlatformArch?
        /// The target operating system for the model. Linux is the only operating system that is currently supported.
