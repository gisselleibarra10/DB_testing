For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from StopModel. In this case, safely retry your call to StopModel by using the same ClientToken parameter value. If you don't supply a value for ClientToken, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple stop requests. You'll need to provide your own value for other use cases. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken is considered a new call to StopModel. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.
