For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from CreateDataset. In this case, safely retry your call to CreateDataset by using the same ClientToken parameter value. If you don't supply a value for ClientToken, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple dataset creation requests. You'll need to provide your own value for other use cases. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken is considered a new call to CreateDataset. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.

If you don't specify DatasetSource, an empty dataset is created and the operation synchronously returns. Later, you can add JSON Lines by calling [UpdateDatasetEntries]. If you specify a value for DataSource, the manifest at the S3 location is validated and used to create the dataset. The call to CreateDataset is asynchronous and might take a while to complete.
