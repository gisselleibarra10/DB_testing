    /// The amount of time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. This delay lets an instance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates instance metrics, resulting in more reliable usage data. Set this value equal to the amount of time that it takes for resource consumption to become stable after an instance reaches the InService state. For more information, see [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. To manage your warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, even if its value is set to 0 seconds. This also optimizes the performance of scaling policies that scale continuously, such as target tracking and step scaling policies. If you need to remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify -1 for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup enabled by specifying a minimum value of 0.
