If all your On-Demand capacity cannot be fulfilled using your highest priority instance, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches the remaining capacity using the second priority instance type, and so on.

If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized (recommended), the Auto Scaling group launches instances using Spot pools that are optimally chosen based on the available Spot capacity. Alternatively, you can use capacity-optimized-prioritized and set the order of instance types in the list of launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list).
