For more information, see [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. To manage your warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, even if its value is set to 0 seconds. This also optimizes the performance of scaling policies that scale continuously, such as target tracking and step scaling policies. If you need to remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify -1 for the value.
