For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Auto Scaling group by 25 percent and you specify a MinAdjustmentMagnitude of 2. If the group has 4 instances and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a MinAdjustmentMagnitude of 2, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scales out the group by 2 instances. Valid only if the policy type is StepScaling or SimpleScaling. For more information, see [Scaling adjustment types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-adjustment) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
