To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single topic, use MessageGroupId values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the topic, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion. You must associate a non-empty MessageGroupId with a message. If you don't provide a MessageGroupId, the action fails. The length of MessageGroupId is 128 characters. MessageGroupId can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~). MessageGroupId is required for FIFO topics.
