    ///
    /// * DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    ///
    /// * DisplayName – The display name to use for a topic with SMS subscriptions.
    ///
    /// * Policy – The policy that defines who can access your topic. By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.
    ///
    ///
    /// The following attribute applies only to [server-side-encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html):
    ///
    /// * KmsMasterKeyId – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html#sse-key-terms). For more examples, see [KeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters) in the Key Management Service API Reference.

    /// * ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.

    /// * By default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false, you must specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the [Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html) action.
    ///
    /// * When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).
