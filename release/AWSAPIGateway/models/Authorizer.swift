        /// Specifies the authorizer's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For TOKEN or REQUEST authorizers, this must be a well-formed Lambda function URI, for example, arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:{account_id}:function:{lambda_function_name}/invocations. In general, the URI has this form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{service_api}, where {region} is the same as the region hosting the Lambda function, path indicates that the remaining substring in the URI should be treated as the path to the resource, including the initial /. For Lambda functions, this is usually of the form /2015-03-31/functions/[FunctionARN]/invocations.

For a TOKEN or COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer, this is required and specifies the request header mapping expression for the custom header holding the authorization token submitted by the client. For example, if the token header name is Auth, the header mapping expression is method.request.header.Auth. For the REQUEST authorizer, this is required when authorization caching is enabled. The value is a comma-separated string of one or more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. For example, if an Auth header, a Name query string parameter are defined as identity sources, this value is method.request.header.Auth, method.request.querystring.Name. These parameters will be used to derive the authorization caching key and to perform runtime validation of the REQUEST authorizer by verifying all of the identity-related request parameters are present, not null and non-empty. Only when this is true does the authorizer invoke the authorizer Lambda function, otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. The valid value is a string of comma-separated mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. When the authorization caching is not enabled, this property is optional.
        public var identitySource: Swift.String?
        /// A validation expression for the incoming identity token. For TOKEN authorizers, this value is a regular expression. For COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizers, API Gateway will match the aud field of the incoming token from the client against the specified regular expression. It will invoke the authorizer's Lambda function when there is a match. Otherwise, it will return a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. The validation expression does not apply to the REQUEST authorizer.
