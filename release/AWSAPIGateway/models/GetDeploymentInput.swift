In a REST API call, this embed parameter value is a list of comma-separated strings, as in GET /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}?embed=var1,var2. The SDK and other platform-dependent libraries might use a different format for the list. Currently, this request supports only retrieval of the embedded API summary this way. Hence, the parameter value must be a single-valued list containing only the "apisummary" string. For example, GET /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}?embed=apisummary.
