The key is a method response header parameter name and the mapped value is an integration response header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The mapping key must match the pattern of method.response.header.{name}, where name is a valid and unique header name. The mapped non-static value must match the pattern of integration.response.header.{name} or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}, where name is a valid and unique response header name and JSON-expression is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

For example, if the success response returns nothing and the error response returns some string, you could use the .+ regex to match error response. However, make sure that the error response does not contain any newline (\n) character in such cases. If the back end is an AWS Lambda function, the AWS Lambda function error header is matched. For all other HTTP and AWS back ends, the HTTP status code is matched.
