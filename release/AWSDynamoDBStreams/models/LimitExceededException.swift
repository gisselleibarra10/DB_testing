/// There is no limit to the number of daily on-demand backups that can be taken. Up to 500 simultaneous table operations are allowed per account. These operations include CreateTable, UpdateTable, DeleteTable,UpdateTimeToLive, RestoreTableFromBackup, and RestoreTableToPointInTime. The only exception is when you are creating a table with one or more secondary indexes. You can have up to 250 such requests running at a time; however, if the table or index specifications are complex, DynamoDB might temporarily reduce the number of concurrent operations. There is a soft account quota of 2,500 tables.
