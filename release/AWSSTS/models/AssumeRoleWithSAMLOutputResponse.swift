    /// The value in the SourceIdentity attribute in the SAML assertion. You can require users to set a source identity value when they assume a role. You do this by using the sts:SourceIdentity condition key in a role trust policy. That way, actions that are taken with the role are associated with that user. After the source identity is set, the value cannot be changed. It is present in the request for all actions that are taken by the role and persists across [chained role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts#iam-term-role-chaining) sessions. You can configure your SAML identity provider to use an attribute associated with your users, like user name or email, as the source identity when calling AssumeRoleWithSAML. You do this by adding an attribute to the SAML assertion. For more information about using source identity, see [Monitor and control actions taken with assumed roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html) in the IAM User Guide. The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-

    /// The value of the NameID element in the Subject element of the SAML assertion.
    public var subject: Swift.String?
    /// The format of the name ID, as defined by the Format attribute in the NameID element of the SAML assertion. Typical examples of the format are transient or persistent. If the format includes the prefix urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format, that prefix is removed. For example, urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient is returned as transient. If the format includes any other prefix, the format is returned with no modifications.
