        /// If you want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record when you register an instance, specify A or AAAA for Type. You specify other settings, such as the IP address for A and AAAA records, when you register an instance. For more information, see [RegisterInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html). The following values are supported: A Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44. AAAA Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. CNAME Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:

        /// * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see [Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html#cloudmap-RegisterInstance-request-Attributes) in the topic [RegisterInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html).

        /// SRV Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following values: priority weight port service-hostname Note the following about the values:
        ///
        /// * The values of priority and weight are both set to 1 and can't be changed.
        ///
        /// * The value of port comes from the value that you specify for the AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when you submit a [RegisterInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html) request.
        ///
        /// * The value of service-hostname is a concatenation of the following values:
        ///
        /// * The value that you specify for InstanceId when you register an instance.
        ///
        /// * The name of the service.
        ///
        /// * The name of the namespace.
