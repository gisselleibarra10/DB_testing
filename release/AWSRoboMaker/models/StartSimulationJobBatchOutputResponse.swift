Completed The simulation batch job completed. A batch is complete when (1) there are no pending simulation job requests in the batch and none of the failed simulation job requests are due to InternalServiceError and (2) when all created simulation jobs have reached a terminal state (for example, Completed or Failed). Canceled The simulation batch job was cancelled. Canceling The simulation batch job is being cancelled. Completing The simulation batch job is completing. TimingOut The simulation job batch is timing out. If a batch timing out, and there are pending requests that were failing due to an internal failure (like InternalServiceError), the batch status will be Failed. If there are no such failing request, the batch status will be TimedOut. TimedOut The simulation batch job timed out.
