It’s important to understand that the totals in InsightsByAssessment are daily counts based on this date — they aren’t a total sum to date. The InsightsByAssessment data is eventually consistent. This means that when you read data from InsightsByAssessment, the response might not instantly reflect the results of a recently completed write or update operation. If you repeat your read request after a few hours, the response returns the latest data. If you delete an assessment or change its status to inactive, InsightsByAssessment includes data for that assessment as follows.
    ///
    /// * Inactive assessments - If Audit Manager collected evidence for your assessment before you changed it inactive, that evidence is included in the InsightsByAssessment counts for that day.

    /// * Deleted assessments - If Audit Manager collected evidence for your assessment before you deleted it, that evidence isn't included in the InsightsByAssessment counts for that day.
