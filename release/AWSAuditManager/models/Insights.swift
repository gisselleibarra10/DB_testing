It’s important to understand that the following totals are daily counts based on this date — they aren’t a total sum to date. The Insights data is eventually consistent. This means that, when you read data from Insights, the response might not instantly reflect the results of a recently completed write or update operation. If you repeat your read request after a few hours, the response should return the latest data. If you delete an assessment or change its status to inactive, InsightsByAssessment includes data for that assessment as follows.
    ///
    /// * Inactive assessments - If Audit Manager collected evidence for your assessment before you changed it inactive, that evidence is included in the InsightsByAssessment counts for that day.
