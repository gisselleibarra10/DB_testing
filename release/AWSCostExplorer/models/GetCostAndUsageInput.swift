    /// Filters Amazon Web Services costs by different dimensions. For example, you can specify SERVICE and LINKED_ACCOUNT and get the costs that are associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest Expression objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For more information, see [Expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html). Valid values for MatchOptions for Dimensions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE. Valid values for MatchOptions for CostCategories and Tags are EQUALS, ABSENT, and CASE_SENSITIVE. Default values are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE.

    public var granularity: CostExplorerClientTypes.Granularity?
    /// You can group Amazon Web Services costs using up to two different groups, either dimensions, tag keys, cost categories, or any two group by types. Valid values for the DIMENSION type are AZ, INSTANCE_TYPE, LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME, INVOICING_ENTITY, LINKED_ACCOUNT, OPERATION, PLATFORM, PURCHASE_TYPE, SERVICE, TENANCY, RECORD_TYPE, and USAGE_TYPE. When you group by the TAG type and include a valid tag key, you get all tag values, including empty strings.

For more information about blended and unblended rates, see [Why does the "blended" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/). Valid values are AmortizedCost, BlendedCost, NetAmortizedCost, NetUnblendedCost, NormalizedUsageAmount, UnblendedCost, and UsageQuantity. If you return the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours and GB). To get more meaningful UsageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups. Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsage requests.
