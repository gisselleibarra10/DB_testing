    /// The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications are sent. The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the cluster owner.
    public var notificationTopicArn: Swift.String?
    /// The status of the Amazon SNS notification topic. Notifications are sent only if the status is active. Valid values: active | inactive
    public var notificationTopicStatus: Swift.String?
    /// The number of cache nodes that the cluster should have. If the value for NumCacheNodes is greater than the sum of the number of current cache nodes and the number of cache nodes pending creation (which may be zero), more nodes are added. If the value is less than the number of existing cache nodes, nodes are removed. If the value is equal to the number of current cache nodes, any pending add or remove requests are canceled. If you are removing cache nodes, you must use the CacheNodeIdsToRemove parameter to provide the IDs of the specific cache nodes to remove. For clusters running Redis, this value must be 1. For clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 40. Adding or removing Memcached cache nodes can be applied immediately or as a pending operation (see ApplyImmediately). A pending operation to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster during its maintenance window, whether by adding or removing nodes in accordance with the scale out architecture, is not queued. The customer's latest request to add or remove nodes to the cluster overrides any previous pending operations to modify the number of cache nodes in the cluster. For example, a request to remove 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes. Similarly, a request to add 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes and vice versa. As Memcached cache nodes may now be provisioned in different Availability Zones with flexible cache node placement, a request to add nodes does not automatically override a previous pending operation to add nodes. The customer can modify the previous pending operation to add more nodes or explicitly cancel the pending request and retry the new request. To cancel pending operations to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster, use the ModifyCacheCluster request and set NumCacheNodes equal to the number of cache nodes currently in the cluster.
