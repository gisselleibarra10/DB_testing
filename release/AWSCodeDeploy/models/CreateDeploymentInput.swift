For example, if ApplicationStop fails, the deployment continues with DownloadBundle. If BeforeBlockTraffic fails, the deployment continues with BlockTraffic. If AfterBlockTraffic fails, the deployment continues with ApplicationStop. If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a deployment to an instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that instance is part of an overall deployment and the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is attempted. During a deployment, the AWS CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for ApplicationStop, BeforeBlockTraffic, and AfterBlockTraffic in the AppSpec file from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec file in the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an error and does not run successfully, the deployment can fail. If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful deployment that will never run successfully, create a new deployment and use ignoreApplicationStopFailures to specify that the ApplicationStop, BeforeBlockTraffic, and AfterBlockTraffic failures should be ignored.
