        /// * S3_OBJECT_OVERSIZE - Macie can retrieve the object. However, the object contains too many entries or its storage size exceeds the quota for an allow list. Try breaking the list into multiple files and ensure that each file doesn't exceed any quotas. Then configure list settings in Macie for each file.
        ///
        /// * S3_THROTTLED - Amazon S3 throttled the request to retrieve the object. Wait a few minutes and then try again.

If the specified object exists, you're not allowed to access it or it's encrypted with an KMS key that you're not allowed to use. Work with your Amazon Web Services administrator to ensure that the list's criteria specify the correct bucket and object names, and you have read access to the bucket and the object. If the object is encrypted, also ensure that it's encrypted with a key that you're allowed to use.
