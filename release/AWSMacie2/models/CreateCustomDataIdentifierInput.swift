If you specify more than one, the occurrences thresholds must be in ascending order by severity, moving from LOW to HIGH. For example, 1 for LOW, 50 for MEDIUM, and 100 for HIGH. If an S3 object contains fewer occurrences than the lowest specified threshold, Amazon Macie doesn't create a finding. If you don't specify any values for this array, Macie creates findings for S3 objects that contain at least one occurrence of text that matches the detection criteria, and Macie assigns the MEDIUM severity to those findings.
