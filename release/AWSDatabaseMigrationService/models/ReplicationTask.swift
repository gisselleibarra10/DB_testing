[StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html) is an improved premigration task assessment operation. The [StartReplicationTaskAssessment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html) operation assesses data type compatibility only between the source and target database of a given migration task. In contrast, [StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html) enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assessments in addition to data type compatibility. These assessments include ones for the validity of primary key definitions and likely issues with database migration performance, among others.
