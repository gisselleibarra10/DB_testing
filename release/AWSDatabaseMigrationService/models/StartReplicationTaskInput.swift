Specifying both values results in an error. The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format. Date Example: --cdc-start-position “2018-03-08T12:12:12” Checkpoint Example: --cdc-start-position "checkpoint:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93" LSN Example: --cdc-start-position “mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373” When you use this task setting with a source PostgreSQL database, a logical replication slot should already be created and associated with the source endpoint. You can verify this by setting the slotName extra connection attribute to the name of this logical replication slot.
