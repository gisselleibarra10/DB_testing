You can verify this by setting the slotName extra connection attribute to the name of this logical replication slot. For more information, see [Extra Connection Attributes When Using PostgreSQL as a Source for DMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.html#CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.ConnectionAttrib).
