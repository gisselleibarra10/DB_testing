        /// Use this attribute to minimize the need to access the backup log and enable DMS to prevent truncation using one of the following two methods. Start transactions in the database: This is the default method. When this method is used, DMS prevents TLOG truncation by mimicking a transaction in the database. As long as such a transaction is open, changes that appear after the transaction started aren't truncated. If you need Microsoft Replication to be enabled in your database, then you must choose this method. Exclusively use sp_repldone within a single task: When this method is used, DMS reads the changes and then uses sp_repldone to mark the TLOG transactions as ready for truncation. Although this method doesn't involve any transactional activities, it can only be used when Microsoft Replication isn't running. Also, when using this method, only one DMS task can access the database at any given time. Therefore, if you need to run parallel DMS tasks against the same database, use the default method.

Or you can specify clear-text values for UserName, Password, ServerName, and Port. You can't specify both.
