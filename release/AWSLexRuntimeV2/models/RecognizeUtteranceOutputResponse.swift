For example, if Amazon Lex V2 did not understand the user intent, it sends the clarificationPrompt configured for the bot. If the intent requires confirmation before taking the fulfillment action, it sends the confirmationPrompt. Another example: Suppose that the Lambda function successfully fulfilled the intent, and sent a message to convey to the user. Then Amazon Lex V2 sends that message in the response.

This is the text that is actually processed to recognize intents and slot values. You can use this information to determine if Amazon Lex V2 is correctly processing the audio that you send.
