    /// * CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html) and [AWS::Serverless](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the [CreateStack] or [UpdateStack] action, and specifying this capability. For more information about macros, see [Using CloudFormation macros to perform custom processing on templates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html).

To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT. If you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack will be in the [REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-describing-stacks.html#d0e11995) state until you execute the change set. By default, CloudFormation specifies UPDATE. You can't use the UPDATE type to create a change set for a new stack or the CREATE type to create a change set for an existing stack.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for condition keys in IAM policies for CloudFormation.

Provided that users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.
