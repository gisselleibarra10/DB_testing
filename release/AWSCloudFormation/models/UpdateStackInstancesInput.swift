When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance update operations:
    ///
    /// * To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.
    ///
    /// * To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You can't specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)
    ///
    /// * To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but don't include the parameter in the list.
    ///
    /// * To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify this property at all.
    ///
    ///
    /// During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use [UpdateStackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html) to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.
