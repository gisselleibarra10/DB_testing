    /// The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to assume when invoking the extension. For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the role must contain a trust relationship with the CloudFormation service principle (resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com). For more information about adding trust relationships, see [Modifying a role trust policy] in the Identity and Access Management User Guide. If your extension calls Amazon Web Services APIs in any of its handlers, you must create an [IAM execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that includes the necessary permissions to call those Amazon Web Services APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation needs to invoke the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your resource type with the appropriate credentials.

For information about generating a schema handler package for the extension you want to register, see [submit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-cli-submit.html) in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide. The user registering the extension must be able to access the package in the S3 bucket. That's, the user needs to have [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html) permissions for the schema handler package. For more information, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazons3.html) in the Identity and Access Management User Guide.
