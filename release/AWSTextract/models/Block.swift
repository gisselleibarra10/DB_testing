extension TextractClientTypes {
    /// A Block represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a Block object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example [DetectDocumentText]), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example [AnalyzeDocument]), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document. An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as [DetectDocumentText], the array of Block objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as [GetDocumentAnalysis], the array is returned over one or more responses. For more information, see [How Amazon Textract Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html).
