    /// The bounding box around the detected page, text, key-value pair, table, table cell, or selection element on a document page. The left (x-coordinate) and top (y-coordinate) are coordinates that represent the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0). The top and left values returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example, if the input image is 700 x 200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350 x 50 pixels, the API returns a left value of 0.5 (350/700) and a top value of 0.25 (50/200). The width and height values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page dimension. For example, if the document page size is 700 x 200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.
