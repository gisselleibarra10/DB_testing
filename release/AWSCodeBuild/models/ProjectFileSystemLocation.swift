You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com, and its mount directory is my-efs-mount-directory, then the location is fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory.
