If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used. Bitbucket The commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used. Amazon S3 The version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use. If sourceVersion is specified at the project level, then this sourceVersion (at the build level) takes precedence.
