    /// The path (including the file name) where the object is stored in the container. Format: // For example, to upload the file mlaw.avi to the folder path premium\canada in the container movies, enter the path premium/canada/mlaw.avi. Do not include the container name in this path. If the path includes any folders that don't exist yet, the service creates them. For example, suppose you have an existing premium/usa subfolder. If you specify premium/canada, the service creates a canada subfolder in the premium folder. You then have two subfolders, usa and canada, in the premium folder. There is no correlation between the path to the source and the path (folders) in the container in AWS Elemental MediaStore. For more information about folders and how they exist in a container, see the [AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/). The file name is the name that is assigned to the file that you upload. The file can have the same name inside and outside of AWS Elemental MediaStore, or it can have the same name. The file name can include or omit an extension.

AWS Elemental MediaStore ignores this header for partially uploaded objects that have streaming upload availability.
