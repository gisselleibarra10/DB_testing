Either the key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. When a ledger is impaired, it is not accessible and does not accept any read or write requests. An impaired ledger automatically returns to an active state after you restore the grants on the key, or re-enable the key that was disabled. However, deleting a customer managed KMS key is irreversible. After a key is deleted, you can no longer access the ledgers that are protected with that key, and the data becomes unrecoverable permanently.
