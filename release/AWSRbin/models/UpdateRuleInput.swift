If a resource is deleted, but it does not have any of the specified tag key and value pairs, it is immediately deleted without being retained by the retention rule.

A Region-level retention rule does not have any resource tags specified. It retains all deleted resources of the specified resource type in the Region in which the rule is created, even if the resources are not tagged.
