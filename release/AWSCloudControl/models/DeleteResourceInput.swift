    /// A unique identifier to ensure the idempotency of the resource request. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency, so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distinguish between request retries and new resource requests. You might retry a resource request to ensure that it was successfully received. A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After that, a resource request with the same client token is treated as a new request. If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion in the request. For more information, see [Ensuring resource operation requests are unique](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations.html#resource-operations-idempotency) in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide.

    /// The identifier for the resource. You can specify the primary identifier, or any secondary identifier defined for the resource type in its resource schema. You can only specify one identifier. Primary identifiers can be specified as a string or JSON; secondary identifiers must be specified as JSON. For compound primary identifiers (that is, one that consists of multiple resource properties strung together), to specify the primary identifier as a string, list the property values in the order they are specified in the primary identifier definition, separated by |. For more information, see [Identifying resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-identifier.html) in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide.

The necessary permissions for each event handler are defined in the [handlers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-schema.html#schema-properties-handlers) section of the [resource type definition schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-schema.html). If you do not specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials. For more information, see [Specifying credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations.html#resource-operations-permissions) in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide.
