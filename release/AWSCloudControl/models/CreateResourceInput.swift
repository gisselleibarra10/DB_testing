    /// A unique identifier to ensure the idempotency of the resource request. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency, so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distinguish between request retries and new resource requests. You might retry a resource request to ensure that it was successfully received. A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After that, a resource request with the same client token is treated as a new request. If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion in the request. For more information, see [Ensuring resource operation requests are unique](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations.html#resource-operations-idempotency) in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide.
