Bucket ARN: arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/ Access point ARN: arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/access-point-name/prefix/ If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be configured to delegate access control to the access point.

SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period. SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.
