/// Storage Gateway returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the activated gateway. It is a string made of information such as your account, gateway name, and Amazon Web Services Region. This ARN is used to reference the gateway in other API operations as well as resource-based authorization. For gateways activated prior to September 02, 2015, the gateway ARN contains the gateway name rather than the gateway ID. Changing the name of the gateway has no effect on the gateway ARN.
