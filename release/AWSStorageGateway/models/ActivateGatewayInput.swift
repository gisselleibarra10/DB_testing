    /// Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the activation key by sending an HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway IP address (port 80). The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your gateway in the query string parameter activationKey. It may also include other activation-related parameters, however, these are merely defaults -- the arguments you pass to the ActivateGateway API call determine the actual configuration of your gateway. For more information, see [Getting activation key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/get-activation-key.html) in the Storage Gateway User Guide.

The gateway Amazon Web Services Region specified must be the same Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon Web Services Region in your Host header in the request. For more information about available Amazon Web Services Regions and endpoints for Storage Gateway, see [ Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

    /// A value that indicates the time zone you want to set for the gateway. The time zone is of the format "GMT-hr:mm" or "GMT+hr:mm". For example, GMT-4:00 indicates the time is 4 hours behind GMT. GMT+2:00 indicates the time is 2 hours ahead of GMT. The time zone is used, for example, for scheduling snapshots and your gateway's maintenance schedule.
