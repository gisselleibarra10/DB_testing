This setting only applies to firewall policies that specify the STRICT_ORDER rule order in the stateful engine options settings.

You must ensure that the priority settings are unique within each policy. You can change the priority settings of your rule groups at any time. To make it easier to insert rule groups later, number them so there's a wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on.
