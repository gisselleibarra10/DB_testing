For every rule, you must specify exactly one of the following standard actions.
        ///
        /// * aws:pass - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and permits it to go to its intended destination.
        ///
        /// * aws:drop - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and blocks it from going to its intended destination.

        /// Additionally, you can specify a custom action. To do this, you define a custom action by name and type, then provide the name you've assigned to the action in this Actions setting. For information about the options, see [CustomAction]. To provide more than one action in this setting, separate the settings with a comma. For example, if you have a custom PublishMetrics action that you've named MyMetricsAction, then you could specify the standard action aws:pass and the custom action with [“aws:pass”, “MyMetricsAction”].
