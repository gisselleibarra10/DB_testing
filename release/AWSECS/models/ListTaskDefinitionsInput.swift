When this parameter is used, ListTaskDefinitions only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListTaskDefinitions request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100.

If maxResults was provided, it is possible the number of results to be fewer than maxResults. This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

    /// The order to sort the results in. Valid values are ASC and DESC. By default, (ASC) task definitions are listed lexicographically by family name and in ascending numerical order by revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed last. Setting this parameter to DESC reverses the sort order on family name and revision. This is so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed first.

    /// The task definition status to filter the ListTaskDefinitions results with. By default, only ACTIVE task definitions are listed. By setting this parameter to INACTIVE, you can view task definitions that are INACTIVE as long as an active task or service still references them. If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the status value constant in each subsequent request.
