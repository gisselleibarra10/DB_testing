    /// The load balancer configuration to use with a service or task set. For specific notes and restrictions regarding the use of load balancers with services and task sets, see the CreateService and CreateTaskSet actions. When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration. This causes tasks to register to and deregister from load balancers. We recommend that you verify this on a test environment before you update the Elastic Load Balancing configuration. A service-linked role is required for services that use multiple target groups. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

        public var containerName: Swift.String?
        /// The port on the container to associate with the load balancer. This port must correspond to a containerPort in the task definition the tasks in the service are using. For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the container instance they're launched on must allow ingress traffic on the hostPort of the port mapping.
        public var containerPort: Swift.Int?
        /// The name of the load balancer to associate with the Amazon ECS service or task set. A load balancer name is only specified when using a Classic Load Balancer. If you are using an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer the load balancer name parameter should be omitted.
        public var loadBalancerName: Swift.String?
        /// The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target group or groups associated with a service or task set. A target group ARN is only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you're using a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN. For services using the ECS deployment controller, you can specify one or multiple target groups. For more information, see [Registering multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, you're required to define two target groups for the load balancer. For more information, see [Blue/green deployment with CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance. Do this when creating your target groups because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. This network mode is required for the Fargate launch type.
