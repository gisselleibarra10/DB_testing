extension EcsClientTypes {
    /// A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a container. You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must have a .env file extension. Each line in an environment file should contain an environment variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and are ignored. For more information about the environment variable file syntax, see [Declare default environment variables in file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/). If there are environment variables specified using the environment parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the variables contained within an environment file. If multiple environment files are specified that contain the same variable, they're processed from the top down. We recommend that you use unique variable names. For more information, see [Specifying environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/taskdef-envfiles.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
