Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType parameter must be omitted. If no capacityProviderStrategy or launchType is specified, the defaultCapacityProviderStrategy for the cluster is used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider] API operation. To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The [PutClusterCapacityProviders] API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.
