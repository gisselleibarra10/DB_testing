        /// The number of cpu units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the --cpu-shares option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level cpu value. You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the [Amazon EC2 Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) detail page by 1,024. Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see [CPU share constraint](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint) in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:
        ///
        /// * Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.
        ///
        /// * Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.
        ///
        ///
        /// On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota.

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container can use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information about the options for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) in the Docker documentation. Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the [LogConfiguration] data type). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent. This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}' The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options.

        /// The max stop timeout value is 120 seconds and if the parameter is not specified, the default value of 30 seconds is used. For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, if the stopTimeout parameter isn't specified, the value set for the Amazon ECS container agent configuration variable ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT is used. If neither the stopTimeout parameter or the ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT agent configuration variable are set, then the default values of 30 seconds for Linux containers and 30 seconds on Windows containers are used. Your container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to use a container stop timeout value. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ecs-init package. If your container instances are launched from version 20190301 or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ecs-init. For more information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

        /// A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. This parameter maps to Sysctls in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the --sysctl option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). We don't recommended that you specify network-related systemControls parameters for multiple containers in a single task that also uses either the awsvpc or host network modes. For tasks that use the awsvpc network mode, the container that's started last determines which systemControls parameters take effect. For tasks that use the host network mode, it changes the container instance's namespaced kernel parameters as well as the containers.
        public var systemControls: [EcsClientTypes.SystemControl]?
        /// A list of ulimits to set in the container. If a ulimit value is specified in a task definition, it overrides the default values set by Docker. This parameter maps to Ulimits in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the --ulimit option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). Valid naming values are displayed in the [Ulimit] data type. Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate use the default resource limit values set by the operating system with the exception of the nofile resource limit parameter which Fargate overrides. The nofile resource limit sets a restriction on the number of open files that a container can use. The default nofile soft limit is 1024 and hard limit is 4096. This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}' This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.

This parameter maps to User in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the --user option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). When running tasks using the host network mode, don't run containers using the root user (UID 0). We recommend using a non-root user for better security. You can specify the user using the following formats. If specifying a UID or GID, you must specify it as a positive integer.
