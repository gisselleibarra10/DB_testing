    /// The capacity provider strategy to update the service to use. if the service uses the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster, the service can be updated to use one or more capacity providers as opposed to the default capacity provider strategy. However, when a service is using a capacity provider strategy that's not the default capacity provider strategy, the service can't be updated to use the cluster's default capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The [PutClusterCapacityProviders] API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the [CreateCapacityProvider] API operation. To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The [PutClusterCapacityProviders] API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.

This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores the Elastic Load Balancing health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.

The container name is as it appears in a container definition. When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration, and then stops the old tasks when the new tasks are running. For services that use rolling updates, you can add, update, or remove Elastic Load Balancing target groups. You can update from a single target group to multiple target groups and from multiple target groups to a single target group. For services that use blue/green deployments, you can update Elastic Load Balancing target groups by using [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html) through CodeDeploy. Note that multiple target groups are not supported for blue/green deployments. For more information see [Register multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. For services that use the external deployment controller, you can add, update, or remove load balancers by using [CreateTaskSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTaskSet.html). Note that multiple target groups are not supported for external deployments. For more information see [Register multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
