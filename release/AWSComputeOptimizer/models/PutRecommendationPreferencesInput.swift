For more information, see [Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/enhanced-infrastructure-metrics.html) in the Compute Optimizer User Guide. You cannot create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups at the organization and account levels. You can create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups only at the resource level by specifying a scope name of ResourceArn and a scope value of the Auto Scaling group Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This will configure the preference for all instances that are part of the specified Auto Scaling group. You also cannot create recommendation preferences at the resource level for instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group. You can create recommendation preferences at the resource level only for standalone instances.
