Performance risk indicates the likelihood of the recommended instance type not meeting the resource needs of your workload. Compute Optimizer calculates an individual performance risk score for each specification of the recommended instance, including CPU, memory, EBS throughput, EBS IOPS, disk throughput, disk IOPS, network throughput, and network PPS. The performance risk of the recommended instance is calculated as the maximum performance risk score across the analyzed resource specifications. The value ranges from 0 - 4, with 0 meaning that the recommended resource is predicted to always provide enough hardware capability. The higher the performance risk is, the more likely you should validate whether the recommendation will meet the performance requirements of your workload before migrating your resource.
