This metric identifies the processing power required to run an application on the instance. Depending on the instance type, tools in your operating system can show a lower percentage than CloudWatch when the instance is not allocated a full processor core. Units: Percent

Units: Percent The Memory metric is returned only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them.
