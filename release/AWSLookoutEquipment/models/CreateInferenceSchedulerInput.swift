    /// The interval (in minutes) of planned delay at the start of each inference segment. For example, if inference is set to run every ten minutes, the delay is set to five minutes and the time is 09:08. The inference scheduler will wake up at the configured interval (which, without a delay configured, would be 09:10) plus the additional five minute delay time (so 09:15) to check your Amazon S3 bucket. The delay provides a buffer for you to upload data at the same frequency, so that you don't have to stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new data.
