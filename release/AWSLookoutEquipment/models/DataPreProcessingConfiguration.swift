For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute. When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate, you must attach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore PT1S, the value for a 15 minute rate is PT15M, and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H
