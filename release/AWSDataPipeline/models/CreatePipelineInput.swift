You are responsible for defining the format and ensuring the uniqueness of this identifier. You use this parameter to ensure idempotency during repeated calls to CreatePipeline. For example, if the first call to CreatePipeline does not succeed, you can pass in the same unique identifier and pipeline name combination on a subsequent call to CreatePipeline. CreatePipeline ensures that if a pipeline already exists with the same name and unique identifier, a new pipeline is not created. Instead, you'll receive the pipeline identifier from the previous attempt. The uniqueness of the name and unique identifier combination is scoped to the AWS account or IAM user credentials.
