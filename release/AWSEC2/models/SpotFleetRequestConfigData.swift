If the cheapest pool doesn't have available capacity, the Spot Instances come from the next cheapest pool that has available capacity. If a pool runs out of capacity before fulfilling your desired capacity, Spot Fleet will continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next cheapest pool. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. diversified - Spot Fleet launches instances from all of the Spot Instance pools that you specify. capacityOptimized (recommended) - Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use capacityOptimizedPrioritized. Set a priority for each instance type by using the Priority parameter for LaunchTemplateOverrides. You can assign the same priority to different LaunchTemplateOverrides. EC2 implements the priorities on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for capacity first. capacityOptimizedPrioritized is supported only if your Spot Fleet uses a launch template. Note that if the OnDemandAllocationStrategy is set to prioritized, the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. Default: lowestPrice
