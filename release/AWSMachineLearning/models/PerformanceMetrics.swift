    ///
    /// * BinaryAUC: The binary MLModel uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC) technique to measure performance.
    ///
    /// * RegressionRMSE: The regression MLModel uses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) technique to measure performance. RMSE measures the difference between predicted and actual values for a single variable.
    ///
    /// * MulticlassAvgFScore: The multiclass MLModel uses the F1 score technique to measure performance.
