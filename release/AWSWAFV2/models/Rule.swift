This is used only for rules whose statements do not reference a rule group. Rule statements that reference a rule group include RuleGroupReferenceStatement and ManagedRuleGroupStatement. You must specify either this Action setting or the rule OverrideAction setting, but not both:

This option is usually set to none. It does not affect how the rules in the rule group are evaluated.

A fully qualified label is the concatenation of a label namespace and a rule label. The rule's rule group or web ACL defines the label namespace. Rules that run after this rule in the web ACL can match against these labels using a LabelMatchStatement. For each label, provide a case-sensitive string containing optional namespaces and a label name, according to the following guidelines:
        ///

        ///
        /// * Each namespace or name can have up to 128 characters.

        /// * You can specify up to 5 namespaces in a label.
