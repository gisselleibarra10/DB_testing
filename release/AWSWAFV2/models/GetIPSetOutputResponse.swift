To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException. If this happens, perform another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.
