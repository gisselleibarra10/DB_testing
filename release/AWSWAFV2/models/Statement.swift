The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer guide, this is called a string match statement.

To use this, create an [IPSet] that specifies the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. To create an IP set, see [CreateIPSet]. Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

        /// A rule statement that defines a string match search against labels that have been added to the web request by rules that have already run in the web ACL. The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match statement.
        public var labelMatchStatement: Wafv2ClientTypes.LabelMatchStatement?
        /// A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a managed rule group. To use this, provide the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this statement. You can retrieve the required names by calling [ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups]. You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement, for example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. It can only be referenced as a top-level statement within a rule. You are charged additional fees when you use the WAF Bot Control managed rule group AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet or the WAF Fraud Control account takeover prevention (ATP) managed rule group AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet.

        public var orStatement: Wafv2ClientTypes.OrStatement?
        /// A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests. WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF. When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit. You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:
        ///
        /// * An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.
        ///
        /// * A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.
        ///
        ///
        /// In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule. You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside another statement, for example inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. You can define a RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

To use this, create a [RegexPatternSet] that specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set, see [CreateRegexPatternSet]. Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

        /// A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes. If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request body for your web requests never exceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a request body greater than 8192 bytes. If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI /logo.jpg is nine characters long.
