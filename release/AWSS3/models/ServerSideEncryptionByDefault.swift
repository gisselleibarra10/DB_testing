    /// Describes the default server-side encryption to apply to new objects in the bucket. If a PUT Object request doesn't specify any server-side encryption, this default encryption will be applied. If you don't specify a customer managed key at configuration, Amazon S3 automatically creates an Amazon Web Services KMS key in your Amazon Web Services account the first time that you add an object encrypted with SSE-KMS to a bucket. By default, Amazon S3 uses this KMS key for SSE-KMS. For more information, see [PUT Bucket encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTencryption.html) in the Amazon S3 API Reference.
    public struct ServerSideEncryptionByDefault: Swift.Equatable {
        /// Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) customer Amazon Web Services KMS key ID to use for the default encryption. This parameter is allowed if and only if SSEAlgorithm is set to aws:kms. You can specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. However, if you are using encryption with cross-account or Amazon Web Services service operations you must use a fully qualified KMS key ARN. For more information, see [Using encryption for cross-account operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html#bucket-encryption-update-bucket-policy). For example:
        ///

        ///

        /// Amazon S3 only supports symmetric KMS keys and not asymmetric KMS keys. For more information, see [Using symmetric and asymmetric keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide.
