    /// Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a Filter in your replication configuration, you must also include a DeleteMarkerReplication element. If your Filter includes a Tag element, the DeleteMarkerReplicationStatus must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config). For more information about delete marker replication, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-marker-replication.html). If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see [Backward Compatibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations).
