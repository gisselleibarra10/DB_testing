    ///
    /// * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.
    ///
    /// * For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:::accesspoint//object/. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded. Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:::outpost//object/. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf.
