You use this with [DocumentAttributeTarget to apply the condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html). For example, you can create the 'Department' target field and have it prefill department names associated with the documents based on information in the 'Source_URI' field. Set the condition that if the 'Source_URI' field contains 'financial' in its URI value, then prefill the target field 'Department' with the target value 'Finance' for the document. Amazon Kendra cannot create a target field if it has not already been created as an index field. After you create your index field, you can create a document metadata field using DocumentAttributeTarget. Amazon Kendra then will map your newly created metadata field to your index field.
