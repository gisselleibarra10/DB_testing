Web proxy credentials are optional and you can use them to connect to a web proxy server that requires basic authentication of user name and password. To store web proxy credentials, you use a secret in Secrets Manager. It is recommended that you follow best security practices when configuring your web proxy. This includes setting up throttling, setting up logging and monitoring, and applying security patches on a regular basis. If you use your web proxy with multiple data sources, sync jobs that occur at the same time could strain the load on your proxy. It is recommended you prepare your proxy beforehand for any security and load requirements.
