    /// This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide. For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. A combination of [ByteMatchSet], [IPSet], and/or [SqlInjectionMatchSet] objects that identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, you might create a Rule that includes the following predicates:
    ///
    /// * An IPSet that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests that originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44
    ///
    /// * A ByteMatchSet that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests for which the value of the User-Agent header is BadBot.
    ///
    ///
    /// To match the settings in this Rule, a request must originate from 192.0.2.44 AND include a User-Agent header for which the value is BadBot.
    public struct Rule: Swift.Equatable {
        /// A friendly name or description for the metrics for this Rule. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change MetricName after you create the Rule.
        public var metricName: Swift.String?
        /// The friendly name or description for the Rule. You can't change the name of a Rule after you create it.
        public var name: Swift.String?
        /// The Predicates object contains one Predicate element for each [ByteMatchSet], [IPSet], or [SqlInjectionMatchSet] object that you want to include in a Rule.
        /// This member is required.
        public var predicates: [WafClientTypes.Predicate]?
        /// A unique identifier for a Rule. You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see [GetRule]), update a Rule (see [UpdateRule]), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see [UpdateWebACL]), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see [DeleteRule]). RuleId is returned by [CreateRule] and by [ListRules].
        /// This member is required.
