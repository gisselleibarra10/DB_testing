For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

If a SizeConstraintSet contains more than one SizeConstraint object, a request only needs to match one constraint to be considered a match.

SizeConstraintSetId is returned by [CreateSizeConstraintSet] and by [ListSizeConstraintSets].
