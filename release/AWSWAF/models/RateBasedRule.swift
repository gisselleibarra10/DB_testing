    /// This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide. For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. A RateBasedRule is identical to a regular [Rule], with one addition: a RateBasedRule counts the number of requests that arrive from a specified IP address every five minutes. For example, based on recent requests that you've seen from an attacker, you might create a RateBasedRule that includes the following conditions:
    ///
    /// * The requests come from 192.0.2.44.
    ///
    /// * They contain the value BadBot in the User-Agent header.
    ///
    ///
    /// In the rule, you also define the rate limit as 1,000. Requests that meet both of these conditions and exceed 1,000 requests every five minutes trigger the rule's action (block or count), which is defined in the web ACL.
    public struct RateBasedRule: Swift.Equatable {
        /// The Predicates object contains one Predicate element for each [ByteMatchSet], [IPSet], or [SqlInjectionMatchSet] object that you want to include in a RateBasedRule.
        /// This member is required.
        public var matchPredicates: [WafClientTypes.Predicate]?
        /// A friendly name or description for the metrics for a RateBasedRule. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric after you create the RateBasedRule.
        public var metricName: Swift.String?
        /// A friendly name or description for a RateBasedRule. You can't change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.
        public var name: Swift.String?
        /// The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring. The only valid value for RateKey is IP. IP indicates that requests arriving from the same IP address are subject to the RateLimit that is specified in the RateBasedRule.
        /// This member is required.
        public var rateKey: WafClientTypes.RateKey?
        /// The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the field specified by the RateKey, allowed in a five-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and the other predicates specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the action that is specified for this rule.
