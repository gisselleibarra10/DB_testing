For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. A complex type that contains XssMatchTuple objects, which specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header. If a XssMatchSet contains more than one XssMatchTuple object, a request needs to include cross-site scripting attacks in only one of the specified parts of the request to be considered a match.

        /// The name, if any, of the XssMatchSet.

You use XssMatchSetId to get information about an XssMatchSet (see [GetXssMatchSet]), update an XssMatchSet (see [UpdateXssMatchSet]), insert an XssMatchSet into a Rule or delete one from a Rule (see [UpdateRule]), and delete an XssMatchSet from AWS WAF (see [DeleteXssMatchSet]). XssMatchSetId is returned by [CreateXssMatchSet] and by [ListXssMatchSets].
