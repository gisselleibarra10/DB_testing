    /// A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the source DB cluster snapshot to the target DB cluster snapshot. By default, tags are not copied.
    public var copyTags: Swift.Bool?
    /// The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster snapshot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the Amazon Web Services KMS key. If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Services account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the copy with a new KMS key. If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId, then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot. If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from another Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services Region, you must set KmsKeyId to the Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region. If you copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.
    public var kmsKeyId: Swift.String?
    /// When you are copying a DB cluster snapshot from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API operation in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB cluster snapshot to copy. Use the PreSignedUrl parameter when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region. This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:
    ///
    /// * KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.
    ///
    /// * DestinationRegion - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.
    ///
    /// * SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115.
    ///

    /// To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [ Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [ Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.
    public var preSignedUrl: Swift.String?
    /// The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. You can't copy an encrypted, shared DB cluster snapshot from one Amazon Web Services Region to another. Constraints:
    ///
    /// * Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.
    ///
    /// * If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot identifier.
    ///
    /// * If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services Region than the copy, specify a valid DB cluster snapshot ARN.
