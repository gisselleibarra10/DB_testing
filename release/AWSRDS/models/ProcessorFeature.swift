To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name parameter. You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:
    ///
    /// * CreateDBInstance

    /// * ModifyDBInstance

    /// * RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot
    ///
    /// * RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

    /// * RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime
    ///
    ///
    /// You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass parameter. In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:
    ///
    /// * DescribeDBInstances
    ///
    /// * DescribeDBSnapshots
    ///
    /// * DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications
    ///
    ///
    /// If you call DescribeDBInstances, ProcessorFeature returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:
    ///
    /// * You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.
    ///
    /// * Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
    ///
    /// * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.
    ///
