Valid values are as follows: available You can use this CEV to create a new RDS Custom DB instance. inactive You can create a new RDS Custom instance by restoring a DB snapshot with this CEV. You can't patch or create new instances with this CEV. You can change any status to any status. A typical reason to change status is to prevent the accidental use of a CEV, or to make a deprecated CEV eligible for use again. For example, you might change the status of your CEV from available to inactive, and from inactive back to available. To change the availability status of the CEV, it must not currently be in use by an RDS Custom instance, snapshot, or automated backup.
