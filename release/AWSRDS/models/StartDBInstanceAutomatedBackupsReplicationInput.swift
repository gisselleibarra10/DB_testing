    /// In an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region, an URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the StartDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsReplication operation to call in the Amazon Web Services Region of the source DB instance. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the StartDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsReplication API operation that can run in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance. This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [ Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [ Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.
