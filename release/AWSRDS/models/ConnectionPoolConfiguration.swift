The value is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. With a high value, the proxy leaves a high percentage of idle database connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close more idle connections and return them to the database. Default: The default value is half of the value of MaxConnectionsPercent. For example, if MaxConnectionsPercent is 80, then the default value of MaxIdleConnectionsPercent is 40. If the value of MaxConnectionsPercent isn't specified, then for SQL Server, MaxIdleConnectionsPercent is 5, and for all other engines, the default is 50.
