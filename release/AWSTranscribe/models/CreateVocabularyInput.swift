A custom vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in the same language as the vocabulary. For example, if you create a vocabulary using US English (en-US), you can only apply this vocabulary to files that contain English audio.

The other option for creating your vocabulary is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the VocabularyFileUri parameter. Note that if you include Phrases in your request, you cannot use VocabularyFileUri; you must choose one or the other. Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.
