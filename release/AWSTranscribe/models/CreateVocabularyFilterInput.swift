    /// The language code that represents the language of the entries in your vocabulary filter. Each vocabulary filter must contain terms in only one language. A vocabulary filter can only be used to transcribe files in the same language as the filter. For example, if you create a vocabulary filter using US English (en-US), you can only apply this filter to files that contain English audio. For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the [Supported languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) table.

    /// A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom vocabulary filter. This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

    /// This member is required.
    public var vocabularyFilterName: Swift.String?
    /// Use this parameter if you want to create your vocabulary filter by including all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your request. The other option for creating your vocabulary filter is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter. Note that if you include Words in your request, you cannot use VocabularyFilterFileUri; you must choose one or the other. Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.
