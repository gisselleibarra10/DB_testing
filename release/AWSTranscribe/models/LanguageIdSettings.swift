    /// If using automatic language identification (IdentifyLanguage) in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters (VocabularyName, LanguageModelName, and VocabularyFilterName). You can specify two or more language codes that represent the languages you think may be present in your media; including more than five is not recommended. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The languages you specify must match the languages of the specified custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters. To include language options using IdentifyLanguage without including a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, use LanguageOptions instead of LanguageIdSettings. Including language options can improve the accuracy of automatic language identification. If you want to include a custom language model with your request but do not want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the LanguageModelName sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but do not want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the VocabularyName or VocabularyFilterName (or both) sub-parameter.
