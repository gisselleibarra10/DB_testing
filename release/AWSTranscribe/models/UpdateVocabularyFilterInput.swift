Note that if you include Words in your request, you cannot use VocabularyFilterFileUri; you must choose one or the other. Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to [Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html) to get the character set for your language.
