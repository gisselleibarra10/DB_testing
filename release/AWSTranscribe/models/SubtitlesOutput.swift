If you specified both WebVTT and SubRip subtitle formats, two URIs are provided. If you included OutputBucketName in your transcription job request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included OutputKey in your request, your output is located in the path you specified in your request. If you didn't include OutputBucketName in your transcription job request, your subtitle file is stored in a service-managed bucket, and TranscriptFileUri provides you with a temporary URI you can use for secure access to your subtitle file. Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are only valid for 15 minutes. If you get an AccesDenied error, you can get a new temporary URI by running a GetTranscriptionJob or ListTranscriptionJob request.
