If you need to update a dashboard from an analysis, first convert the analysis to a template by using the [CreateTemplate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTemplate.html) API operation. For SourceTemplate, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source template. The SourceTemplate ARN can contain any Amazon Web Services account and any Amazon QuickSight-supported Amazon Web Services Region. Use the DataSetReferences entity within SourceTemplate to list the replacement datasets for the placeholders listed in the original. The schema in each dataset must match its placeholder.
