/// This error indicates that you are calling an embedding operation in Amazon QuickSight without the required pricing plan on your Amazon Web Services account. Before you can use embedding for anonymous users, a QuickSight administrator needs to add capacity pricing to Amazon QuickSight. You can do this on the Manage Amazon QuickSight page. After capacity pricing is added, you can use the [GetDashboardEmbedUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_GetDashboardEmbedUrl.html) API operation with the --identity-type ANONYMOUS option.
