public struct CreateGrantInput: Swift.Equatable {
    /// Specifies a grant constraint. KMS supports the EncryptionContextEquals and EncryptionContextSubset grant constraints. Each constraint value can include up to 8 encryption context pairs. The encryption context value in each constraint cannot exceed 384 characters. For information about grant constraints, see [Using grant constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-grant-overview.html#grant-constraints) in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. For more information about encryption context, see [Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context) in the Key Management Service Developer Guide . The encryption context grant constraints allow the permissions in the grant only when the encryption context in the request matches (EncryptionContextEquals) or includes (EncryptionContextSubset) the encryption context specified in this structure. The encryption context grant constraints are supported only on [grant operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#terms-grant-operations) that include an EncryptionContext parameter, such as cryptographic operations on symmetric encryption KMS keys. Grants with grant constraints can include the [DescribeKey] and [RetireGrant] operations, but the constraint doesn't apply to these operations. If a grant with a grant constraint includes the CreateGrant operation, the constraint requires that any grants created with the CreateGrant permission have an equally strict or stricter encryption context constraint. You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys. These keys don't support an encryption context.

When this value is absent, all CreateGrant requests result in a new grant with a unique GrantId even if all the supplied parameters are identical. This can result in unintended duplicates when you retry the CreateGrant request. When this value is present, you can retry a CreateGrant request with identical parameters; if the grant already exists, the original GrantId is returned without creating a new grant. Note that the returned grant token is unique with every CreateGrant request, even when a duplicate GrantId is returned. All grant tokens for the same grant ID can be used interchangeably.

If you try, KMS returns a ValidationError exception.
