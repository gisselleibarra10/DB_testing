/// The request was rejected because the associated CloudHSM cluster did not meet the configuration requirements for a custom key store.
///
/// * The cluster must be configured with private subnets in at least two different Availability Zones in the Region.
///
/// * The [security group for the cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/configure-sg.html) (cloudhsm-cluster--sg) must include inbound rules and outbound rules that allow TCP traffic on ports 2223-2225. The Source in the inbound rules and the Destination in the outbound rules must match the security group ID. These rules are set by default when you create the cluster. Do not delete or change them. To get information about a particular security group, use the [DescribeSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSecurityGroups.html) operation.
///
/// * The cluster must contain at least as many HSMs as the operation requires. To add HSMs, use the CloudHSM [CreateHsm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html) operation. For the [CreateCustomKeyStore], [UpdateCustomKeyStore], and [CreateKey] operations, the CloudHSM cluster must have at least two active HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone. For the [ConnectCustomKeyStore] operation, the CloudHSM must contain at least one active HSM.
