    /// Specifies the encryption context that will be used when encrypting the private key in the data key pair. An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended. For more information, see [Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context) in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

For more information, see [Grant token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#grant_token) and [Using a grant token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-manage.html#using-grant-token) in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the [DescribeKey] operation. To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN. For example:
    ///
    /// * Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
    ///
    /// * Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
    ///

    ///
    /// * Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias
    ///
    /// * Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

The KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA and SM2 KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt or to sign and verify (but not both), and the rule that permits you to use ECC KMS keys only to sign and verify, are not effective on data key pairs, which are used outside of KMS. The SM2 key spec is only available in China Regions. RSA and ECC asymmetric key pairs are also available in China Regions.
