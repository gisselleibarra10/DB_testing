/// The request was rejected for one of the following reasons:
///
/// * The KeyUsage value of the KMS key is incompatible with the API operation.
///
/// * The encryption algorithm or signing algorithm specified for the operation is incompatible with the type of key material in the KMS key (KeySpec).
///
///
/// For encrypting, decrypting, re-encrypting, and generating data keys, the KeyUsage must be ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. For signing and verifying messages, the KeyUsage must be SIGN_VERIFY. For generating and verifying message authentication codes (MACs), the KeyUsage must be GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC. To find the KeyUsage of a KMS key, use the [DescribeKey] operation. To find the encryption or signing algorithms supported for a particular KMS key, use the [DescribeKey] operation.
