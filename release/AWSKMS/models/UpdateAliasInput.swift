You don't have permission to associate an alias with an [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk). The KMS key must be in the same Amazon Web Services account and Region as the alias. Also, the new target KMS key must be the same type as the current target KMS key (both symmetric or both asymmetric) and they must have the same key usage. Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. For example:
    ///
    /// * Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
    ///
    /// * Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
    ///
    ///
    /// To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use [ListKeys] or [DescribeKey]. To verify that the alias is mapped to the correct KMS key, use [ListAliases].
    /// This member is required.
