The standard ciphertext format for asymmetric KMS keys does not include fields for metadata. An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended. For more information, see [Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context) in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

To find the KeyUsage value of a KMS key, use the [DescribeKey] operation. To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN. For example:
    ///

If you identify a different KMS key, the ReEncrypt operation throws an IncorrectKeyException. This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS key, KMS can get the KMS key from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend. To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/". To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN. For example:
