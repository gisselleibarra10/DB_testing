/// The request was rejected because the specified CloudHSM cluster has a different cluster certificate than the original cluster. You cannot use the operation to specify an unrelated cluster. Specify a cluster that shares a backup history with the original cluster. This includes clusters that were created from a backup of the current cluster, and clusters that were created from the same backup that produced the current cluster. Clusters that share a backup history have the same cluster certificate. To view the cluster certificate of a cluster, use the [DescribeClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation.
