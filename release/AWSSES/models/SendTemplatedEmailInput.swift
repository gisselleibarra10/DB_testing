/// Represents a request to send a templated email using Amazon SES. For more information, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-personalized-email-api.html).
public struct SendTemplatedEmailInput: Swift.Equatable {
    /// The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email using SendTemplatedEmail.
    public var configurationSetName: Swift.String?
    /// The destination for this email, composed of To:, CC:, and BCC: fields. A Destination can include up to 50 recipients across these three fields.
    /// This member is required.

    /// The reply-to email address(es) for the message. If the recipient replies to the message, each reply-to address will receive the reply.
    public var replyToAddresses: [Swift.String]?
    /// The email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient's ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.
    public var returnPath: Swift.String?
    /// This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the ReturnPath parameter. For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com, then you would specify the ReturnPathArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com. For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html).
    public var returnPathArn: Swift.String?
    /// The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html). If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html). Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in [RFC6531](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531). For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain [7-bit ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part). If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in [RFC3492](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492.html). The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in[RFC 2047](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047). MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=.
    /// This member is required.
    public var source: Swift.String?
    /// This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the Source parameter. For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from user@example.com, then you would specify the SourceArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the Source to be user@example.com.
