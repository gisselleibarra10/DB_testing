/// Enable or disable the Deliverability dashboard. When you enable the Deliverability dashboard, you gain access to reputation, deliverability, and other metrics for the domains that you use to send email using Amazon SES API v2. You also gain the ability to perform predictive inbox placement tests. When you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly subscription charge, in addition to any other fees that you accrue by using Amazon SES and other Amazon Web Services services.
