    /// The constraint parameters, in JSON format. The syntax depends on the constraint type as follows: LAUNCH You are required to specify either the RoleArn or the LocalRoleName but can't use both. Specify the RoleArn property as follows: {"RoleArn" : "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/LaunchRole"} Specify the LocalRoleName property as follows: {"LocalRoleName": "SCBasicLaunchRole"} If you specify the LocalRoleName property, when an account uses the launch constraint, the IAM role with that name in the account will be used. This allows launch-role constraints to be account-agnostic so the administrator can create fewer resources per shared account. The given role name must exist in the account used to create the launch constraint and the account of the user who launches a product with this launch constraint. You cannot have both a LAUNCH and a STACKSET constraint. You also cannot have more than one LAUNCH constraint on a product and portfolio. NOTIFICATION Specify the NotificationArns property as follows: {"NotificationArns" : ["arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:Topic"]} RESOURCE_UPDATE Specify the TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct property as follows: {"Version":"2.0","Properties":{"TagUpdateOnProvisionedProduct":"String"}} The TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct property accepts a string value of ALLOWED or NOT_ALLOWED. STACKSET Specify the Parameters property as follows: {"Version": "String", "Properties": {"AccountList": [ "String" ], "RegionList": [ "String" ], "AdminRole": "String", "ExecutionRole": "String"}} You cannot have both a LAUNCH and a STACKSET constraint. You also cannot have more than one STACKSET constraint on a product and portfolio. Products with a STACKSET constraint will launch an CloudFormation stack set. TEMPLATE Specify the Rules property. For more information, see [Template Constraint Rules](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/reference-template_constraint_rules.html).
