We recommend using the default setting for the majority of use cases. Generally, workloads that write in fixed small or large record sizes may benefit from setting a custom record size, like database workloads (small record size) or media streaming workloads (large record size). For additional guidance on when to set a custom record size, see [ ZFS Record size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/performance.html#record-size-performance) in the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide.

A volume quota limits the amount of storage that the volume can consume to the configured amount, but does not guarantee the space will be available on the parent volume. To guarantee quota space, you must also set StorageCapacityReservationGiB. To not specify a storage capacity quota, set this to -1.
