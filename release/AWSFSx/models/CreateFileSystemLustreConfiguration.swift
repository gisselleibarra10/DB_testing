Choose PERSISTENT_1 for longer-term storage and for throughput-focused workloads that aren’t latency-sensitive. PERSISTENT_1 supports encryption of data in transit, and is available in all Amazon Web Services Regions in which FSx for Lustre is available. Choose PERSISTENT_2 for longer-term storage and for latency-sensitive workloads that require the highest levels of IOPS/throughput. PERSISTENT_2 supports SSD storage, and offers higher PerUnitStorageThroughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB). PERSISTENT_2 is available in a limited number of Amazon Web Services Regions.

The path must use the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. If an ExportPath value is not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default export path, s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]. The timestamp is in UTC format, for example s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z. The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket specified by ImportPath. If you specify only a bucket name, such as s3://import-bucket, you get a 1:1 mapping of file system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in the export path, such as s3://import-bucket/[custom-optional-prefix], Amazon FSx exports the contents of your file system to that export prefix in the Amazon S3 bucket.

If you specify a prefix after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.
