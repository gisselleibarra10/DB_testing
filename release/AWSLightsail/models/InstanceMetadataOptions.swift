If you retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role credentials are returned. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials by using a valid signed token, the version 2.0 role credentials are returned. If the state is required, you must send a signed token header with all instance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the IAM role credential always returns the version 2.0 credentials. The version 1.0 credentials are not available. Not all instance blueprints in Lightsail support version 2.0 credentials. Use the MetadataNoToken instance metric to track the number of calls to the instance metadata service that are using version 1.0 credentials. For more information, see [Viewing instance metrics in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-health-metrics) in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide.
