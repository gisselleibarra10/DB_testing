The domain names that you specify are used when you create a deployment with a container configured as the public endpoint of your container service. If you don't specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service. You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service. You can specify public domain names using a string to array map as shown in the example later on this page.
