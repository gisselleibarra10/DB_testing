For example, if your container service name is container-service-1, the container image label is mystaticsite, and you want to use the third (3) version of the registered container image, then you should specify :container-service-1.mystaticsite.3. To use the latest version of a container image, specify latest instead of a version number (for example, :container-service-1.mystaticsite.latest). Lightsail will automatically use the highest numbered version of the registered container image. Container images sourced from a public registry like Docker Hub don't start with a colon. For example, nginx:latest or nginx.
