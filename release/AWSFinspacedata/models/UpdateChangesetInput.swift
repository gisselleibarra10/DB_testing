    /// * CSV – CSV source file format.

    /// * JSON – JSON source file format.

    /// Here is an example of how you could specify the formatParams:  "formatParams": { "formatType": "CSV", "withHeader": "true", "separator": ",", "compression":"None" }  Note that if you only provide formatType as CSV, the rest of the attributes will automatically default to CSV values as following:  { "withHeader": "true", "separator": "," }  For more information about supported file formats, see [Supported Data Types and File Formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/finspace/latest/userguide/supported-data-types.html) in the FinSpace User Guide.

    /// Options that define the location of the data being ingested (s3SourcePath) and the source of the changeset (sourceType). Both s3SourcePath and sourceType are required attributes. Here is an example of how you could specify the sourceParams:  "sourceParams": { "s3SourcePath": "s3://finspace-landing-us-east-2-bk7gcfvitndqa6ebnvys4d/scratch/wr5hh8pwkpqqkxa4sxrmcw/ingestion/equity.csv", "sourceType": "S3" }  The S3 path that you specify must allow the FinSpace role access. To do that, you first need to configure the IAM policy on S3 bucket. For more information, see [Loading data from an Amazon S3 Bucket using the FinSpace API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/finspace/latest/data-api/fs-using-the-finspace-api.html#access-s3-buckets)section.
