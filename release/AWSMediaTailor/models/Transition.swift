Note the following considerations when using ABSOLUTE transitions: If the preceding program in the schedule has a duration that extends past the wall clock time, MediaTailor truncates the preceding program on a common segment boundary. If there are gaps in playback, MediaTailor plays the FillerSlate you configured for your linear channel. RELATIVE - The program is inserted into the schedule either before or after a program that you specify via RelativePosition.
