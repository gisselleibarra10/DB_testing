    /// The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment runs a specific job. Compute environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed. All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.
    /// This member is required.
    public var computeEnvironmentOrder: [BatchClientTypes.ComputeEnvironmentOrder]?
    /// The name of the job queue. It can be up to 128 letters long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
    /// This member is required.
    public var jobQueueName: Swift.String?
    /// The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of 1. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

If this parameter isn't specified, the job queue uses a first in, first out (FIFO) scheduling policy. After a job queue is created, you can replace but can't remove the fair share scheduling policy. The format is aws:Partition:batch:Region:Account:scheduling-policy/Name . An example is aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:012345678910:scheduling-policy/MySchedulingPolicy.
    public var schedulingPolicyArn: Swift.String?
