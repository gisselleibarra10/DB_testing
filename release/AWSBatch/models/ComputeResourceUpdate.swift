This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or [Amazon EC2 service limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html). For more information, see [Allocation strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html) in the Batch User Guide.

BEST_FIT isn't supported when updating a compute environment. This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, Batch will select new instance types. SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources. With both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED strategies, Batch might need to go above maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance.

To remove the custom AMI ID and use the default AMI ID, set this value to an empty string. When updating a compute environment, changing the AMI ID requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the Batch User Guide. This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

You can also choose optimal to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues. When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment. Currently, optimal uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.

To remove the custom launch template and use the default launch template, set launchTemplateId or launchTemplateName member of the launch template specification to an empty string. Removing the launch template from a compute environment will not remove the AMI specified in the launch template. In order to update the AMI specified in a launch template, the updateToLatestImageVersion parameter must be set to true. When updating a compute environment, changing the launch template requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment.
