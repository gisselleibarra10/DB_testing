When this parameter is used, ListSchedulingPolicies only returns maxResults results in a single page and a nextToken response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another ListSchedulingPolicies request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
