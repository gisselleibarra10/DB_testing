    /// An object representing an Batch compute resource. For more information, see [Compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) in the Batch User Guide.

        /// The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or [Amazon EC2 service limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html). For more information, see [Allocation strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html) in the Batch User Guide. This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. BEST_FIT (default) Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is reaching [Amazon EC2 service limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified. Compute resources that use a BEST_FIT allocation strategy don't support infrastructure updates and can't update some parameters. For more information, see [Updating compute environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html) in the Batch User Guide. BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, Batch will select new instance types. SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources. With both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED strategies, Batch might need to go above maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance.
        public var allocationStrategy: BatchClientTypes.CRAllocationStrategy?
        /// The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price. This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

You can also choose optimal to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues. This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment. Currently, optimal uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. To tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet IAM role specified here must use the newer AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole managed policy. The previously recommended AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole managed policy doesn't have the required permissions to tag Spot Instances.
