The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another DescribeComputeEnvironments request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100.

Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return. This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
