If you specify a value for MaximumExecutionFrequency, then MessageType must use the ScheduledNotification value. By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter. Based on the valid value you choose, Config runs evaluations once for each valid value. For example, if you choose Three_Hours, Config runs evaluations once every three hours. In this case, Three_Hours is the frequency of this rule.

        ///
        /// * OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Triggers an evaluation when Config delivers an oversized configuration item. Config may generate this notification type when a resource changes and the notification exceeds the maximum size allowed by Amazon SNS.
        ///
        /// * ScheduledNotification - Triggers a periodic evaluation at the frequency specified for MaximumExecutionFrequency.
        ///
        /// * ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted - Triggers a periodic evaluation when Config delivers a configuration snapshot.
