/// * No permission to call EnableAWSServiceAccess API

/// * The configuration aggregator cannot be updated because your Amazon Web Services Organization management account or the delegated administrator role changed. Delete this aggregator and create a new one with the current Amazon Web Services Organization.
///
/// * The configuration aggregator is associated with a previous Amazon Web Services Organization and Config cannot aggregate data with current Amazon Web Services Organization. Delete this aggregator and create a new one with the current Amazon Web Services Organization.
