    /// Config rules evaluate the configuration settings of your Amazon Web Services resources. A rule can run when Config detects a configuration change to an Amazon Web Services resource or at a periodic frequency that you choose (for example, every 24 hours). There are two types of rules: Config Managed Rules and Config Custom Rules. Managed rules are predefined, customizable rules created by Config. For a list of managed rules, see [List of Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html). Custom rules are rules that you can create using either Guard or Lambda functions. Guard ([Guard GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)) is a policy-as-code language that allows you to write policies that are enforced by Config Custom Policy rules. Lambda uses custom code that you upload to evaluate a custom rule. It is invoked by events that are published to it by an event source, which Config invokes when the custom rule is initiated. For more information about developing and using Config rules, see [Evaluating Amazon Web Services resource Configurations with Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) in the Config Developer Guide. You can use the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon Web Services SDKs if you want to create a rule that triggers evaluations for your resources when Config delivers the configuration snapshot. For more information, see [ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties].

Config sets the state of the rule to EVALUATING temporarily after you use the StartConfigRulesEvaluation request to evaluate your resources against the Config rule. Config sets the state of the rule to DELETING_RESULTS temporarily after you use the DeleteEvaluationResults request to delete the current evaluation results for the Config rule. Config temporarily sets the state of a rule to DELETING after you use the DeleteConfigRule request to delete the rule. After Config deletes the rule, the rule and all of its evaluations are erased and are no longer available.
