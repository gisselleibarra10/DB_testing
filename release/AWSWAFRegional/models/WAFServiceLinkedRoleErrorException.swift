/// AWS WAF is not able to access the service linked role. This can be caused by a previous PutLoggingConfiguration request, which can lock the service linked role for about 20 seconds. Please try your request again. The service linked role can also be locked by a previous DeleteServiceLinkedRole request, which can lock the role for 15 minutes or more. If you recently made a DeleteServiceLinkedRole, wait at least 15 minutes and try the request again. If you receive this same exception again, you will have to wait additional time until the role is unlocked.
