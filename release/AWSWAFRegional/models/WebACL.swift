For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. Contains the Rules that identify the requests that you want to allow, block, or count. In a WebACL, you also specify a default action (ALLOW or BLOCK), and the action for each Rule that you add to a WebACL, for example, block requests from specified IP addresses or block requests from specified referrers. You also associate the WebACL with a CloudFront distribution to identify the requests that you want AWS WAF to filter. If you add more than one Rule to a WebACL, a request needs to match only one of the specifications to be allowed, blocked, or counted. For more information, see [UpdateWebACL].
